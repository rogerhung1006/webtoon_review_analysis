so I\u2019m going to try and be quick. I absolutely love love love webtoon. I know fast pass is annoying because you have to wait so long but it really is worth it because there are literally so many amazing story\u2019s for whatever you like. I was actually going to give this a 5 star review until it glitched. I\u2019m reading this super great story called \u201cMy Deepest Secret\u201d witch is soooooooooo good and probably one of my favorite story\u2019s. But... I\u2019ve been waiting seven days for the next one to come out because of fast pass and it\u2019s felt like forever because I love this story and the episode before the one coming out ended at a cliffhanger so I was so excited. it said it would come out in like 8 house yesterday in the morning. I forgot about that and looked to read it today. I go and it says 7 days still. it didn\u2019t come out it says I have to wait another seven days!!! I\u2019m really mad about this because I don\u2019t spend money on story\u2019s and now I have to wait longer because of a stupid glitch the app had. If anyone is reading this who wants to get this app you totally should because it\u2019s amazing and this is really the first time this has ever happened. I don\u2019t like complaining really but I just wanted to write this mostly for the people who made the app because I am sad and mad about what happened and just really wanna read my book. Please try and make sure these glitches never happen again cause it really made me disappointed. Thank you so much.","1":"I used to be very happy with the app until they added Daily Pass to some Completed Webtoons. I like to go back to some completed Webtoons and re read and not have to face a cliff hanger or wait for next episode. Due to the new Daily Pass, i can only read 2 episodes a day (besides the first 6 few ones). I really don't enjoy this cause I've already read these webtoons and would like to be able to read them over and over again. For example, Orange Marmalade is an amazing Webtoon and has 119 Episodes. I've already read this story at least 5 times if not more. I recently came back to re-read and by doing the math, i have to wait 2 months to finish. It's just a way for the company to make more money and i'm a \"free to play\" reader and i'd rather spend my money on webtoon merch. Could webtoon please either remove daily pass or at least make the daily pass make the episode free after use instead of the episode being unavailable after 14 days? I know i'm not the only one upset about this. I may only have been on Webtoon for 2 and half years, but i still love to read the older ones and re read the ones which have already been completed. It's also inconvenient because right now a series could be near completion and i can read all the released episodes (non fast pass) whenever i want but after the \"grace period\" i won't be able to. Please do something about this because i'm not the only one who is upset about this.","2":"I absolutely love Webtoon. I honestly can\u2019t imagine my life without it now because these stories have made me laugh, cry, and even get angry. It\u2019s a really positive environment. When free pass came I had no mind to it. I actually really liked it because it was a nice way to be able to read episodes that haven\u2019t been release yet! But then came the daily passes for some completed series. I don\u2019t like to complain but daily pass is just so annoying because I can\u2019t reread my favorite completed series over and over again. For example the completed series Winter Woods. It is SUCH a good series and I can no longer reread it as much as I wanted to. With the daily pass it would take MONTHS or WEEKS to finish the series again, and not only that but the episodes you unlock from daily pass are only for a limited amount of time. Also there\u2019s another issue I wanted to bring to light. There are these users that keep going around in the comment sections of Webtoons, and they post links to innapropriate sites or viruses that\u2019s really dangerous. I know better than to click on them, and I report those comments when I get the chance, but of course there are also young people who go on Webtoon and might click on these links because they might not know any better. If Webtoon could please figure out a way to deal with these perverse users that keep posting these links in some way, it would be a really big help for Webtoon readers.","3":"I absolutely love this app. The comics here are amazing. I have been using this app since 2017. Since then I've read many other types of comics. I don't mind having to wait a week to read another chapter, considering how hard the artist is working each day to upload the next chapter. They also have completed series which I do enjoy because there isn't any cliffhanger. Now, webtoon has changed a lot in a good way and in a bad way too. Now there is a fast pass which I don't mind. I haven't purchased coins because I don't feel like I need to. Like I said I don't mind waiting a week. People have their right to spend their hard-earned money on whatever they want. There are also events where webtoon gives free coins that I have used. But recently I've had my first dilemma with this app. It has to do with the series that are already completed. Before you were able to read them freely as you like, but now you have to wait for a day to read the next chapter. I don't mind having to wait but doesn't mean I have to. When unlocking a chapter it's only for a limited amount of days. I think that's a bit too much and not necessarily fair to people. I am pleased that the app is growing and gaining the popularity it deserves. But because the app is growing they are taking advantage of it and doing unnecessary \u201dupdates\u201d. If this were to be fixed I and other people will be pleased to read the completed series.","4":"To start, I\u2019d like to say that I absolutely love this app (especially during quarantine). There are so many stories out there to read and all of them are amazing. Genres range from superhero to fantasy and romance to comedy. I\u2019d also like to address one of the top reviews on the app by some 12 year old complaining about having to wait a week for a comic to update. That\u2019s because the writers and artists are making these LIVE. The only ones that are already made are on fast pass and at that point it\u2019s entirely up to you as to whether or not you want to be patient. Not only that, but WEBTOON occasionally has coin events in which case you can get coins for free.\nHowever, I should really get to the point of this review. Lately, there was an option for small artists to gain something along the lines of fast pass (fast pass is only an option for more popular comics) in which the reader watches an ad and then they can read the next chapter early. I wouldn\u2019t mind it since it supports those smaller artists, but it just doesn\u2019t work which is VERY frustrating! I click to play the ad and then it says \u201ccouldn\u2019t load the ad. Please try again later.\u201d It\u2019s been doing this for 4 days! At this point I may as well wait until it\u2019s available without the ad! So please please please fix it! I just want to read the next episodes of Million Dollar Bride and Love n Life.","5":"This app is amazing, and I love all of the comics. All of the stories are unique and different in their own way. I love it.. buuuut... there\u2019s this new thing that\u2019s called a \u201cWebtoon Policy,\u201d and you can only read if you\u2019re 18 or older.. which I understand, but what if you ARE 18 years or older? I\u2019ve read some of the comments on one of the comics I was reading, and they said \u201cThis episode isn\u2019t even inappropriate.\u201d I\u2019ve missed like 10 episodes because of this \u201cWebtoon Policy.\u201d Before I knew this, I was reading all of my comics thinking that I wasn\u2019t missing anything, and the author was just remonding you that the comic has inappropriate language or something, but today was the day (after about a year and a half.. I think) that I figured out that I was missing out on episodes because of a Webtoon Policy. I even tried switching to one of my other accounts, and I still couldn\u2019t read a bunch of episodes. I didn\u2019t get this app to miss out on books I love to read. Something I don\u2019t understand is.. why can some of the people reading the book see it, but some of them can\u2019t? It makes no sense and is NOT fair. Webtoon, I love the app, but please fix this problem. If you can\u2019t fix it, just please get rid of the \u201cWebtoon Policy\u201d and ask the authors to warn the readers that the content might be inappropriate. Thank you \ud83d\ude42","6":"I don\u2019t want to hate on anything that would get more revenue for creators... But daily pass is just ridiculous! If a WEBTOON is completed, it\u2019ll get Daily pass slapped on it and once again readers are unable to read it unless they read one chapter a day ( which is all I get for the pass ) or spend more coins. I\u2019m a broke student, and even if I did have money I unfortunately have other things I could spend it on that would be more permanent. From my understanding of Daily pass, you don\u2019t get to keep the episode free? So why would I spend coins on it if I\u2019m basically just renting it for fourteen days? It doesn\u2019t make sense, and it\u2019s really unappealing for those fans that want to binge read without having to wait for updates. WEBTOON apparently doesn\u2019t understand the joy of reading a finished comic in one sitting, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have added this feature. I won\u2019t spend coins on it, and because of that I most likely will never finish reading, or even start reading, a lot of good comics that I could help support with my poor means by giving a like here and a comment there. The policy changes really hurt a lot of comics and creators, and I guess I understood why they did it ( for all the children downloading apps with age limits ) but Daily pass is like shooting themselves in the foot! I don\u2019t get it at all, and I gave it three stars, because I\u2019m actually upset about this. Daily Pass needs to be revised, or removed. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.","7":"I don\u2019t understand what happened. I was with WEBTOON before all the fast\/daily pass stuff and it was fine. Then came along fast pass. Okay besides that fact that you will have to wait 3 weeks if you fast pass all the episodes and the \u201cFAST PASS GANG WHERE YOU AT??\u201d comments, everything was fine. But then came along daily pass. I was going to reread Days of Hana when all of a sudden I scroll down a few episodes and I see this ridiculous thing called daily pass. And I get about 2 free episodes of the series a day. I moved on to see if Bastard had it as well (I never finished Bastard and I heard it was good so this genuinely upset me) and I saw the same thing. I now realize that I only get about 2 free daily pass thingies a day. So now it makes things frustrating because I can\u2019t even binge read good WEBTOONs that are finished because of this ridiculous system. It\u2019s discouraging for new readers to want to finish it because it will take them around 2 months to even finish an ALREADY FINISHED webtoon, and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a system I noticed to get extra daily passes (I don\u2019t even know what happens if you run out of passes because I never used them). The absolute only reason I even gave some stars was because of the fact that I really enjoy the webtoons on the app. Other than that it\u2019s not as appealing as before and I will return the extra 2 stars if you realize daily pass just isn\u2019t working and you take it away.","8":"A year back, I would\u2019ve given this app a 5\/5 stars. It used to be flawless and perfect in my eyes. Until this year when I finally decided to read \u2018Days of Hana\u2019 again. As a person who had followed the series often and didn\u2019t have an account, I enjoyed checking back to see if it had updated or not. I stopped reading it when it finished, deciding to see what other Webtoon I could read.\n\nNow, in quarantine, I finally decided to read \u2018Orange Marmalade\u2019! I had heard that it was a great story and wanted to read it, though when I went to it, I saw this red sign above the episodes and (I believe) an alarm clock of some sort, I may be wrong though. I didn\u2019t pay any attention to it until I hit the part where it said I couldn\u2019t read anymore. It was so strange! What was it and why was it asking me to wait another day to read it and spend coins on it? I\u2019ve read countless completed Webtoons and this is completely unreasonable. Why would you charge someone to read a completed Webtoon? Is it the Webtoon creator\u2019s choice or is it that Webtoon chooses which one to put Daily Pass on? Or is it all of them? I don\u2019t know but what I do know is that once other Webtoons are completed, Daily Pass will certainly be on many of them. So to earn the 2 stars that I have excluded because of the Daily Pass, please take this in consideration to get the 2 stars back and maybe take the Daily Pass out. Thank you.","9":"I say almost, because Webtoons does ONE thing wrong every single time no matter how many complaints they get. They ALWAYS sent push notifications with spoilers for really good\/popular comics. It doesn\u2019t happen very often, but it\u2019s always when a really important moment happens in a storyline. I wish they would stop, because I really hate spoilers. \n\nAsides from that, the app is wonderful. I\u2019ve been using it and actively spending money as well for a couple years now and I\u2019ve been introduced to so many amazing authors and their stories. The range of art and genres is so fresh and new. 99% of the stories are updated once a week, so it gives me something to look forward to everyday because they don\u2019t all update on the same day. It\u2019s all up to the author. I love knowing that I\u2019m directly supporting these artists\/writers and their dreams. The app is incredibly easy to navigate, super organized from setting a push notifications for the stories you care about whereas you can still see every story you\u2019re subscribed to regardless of the push note, on the same page. It never glitches, and it also allows some brief animation and soundtracks too. This app is going to get much more popular over time, I\u2019m sure of that. How can it not? Good job Webtoons, keep being nice to your authors and stay true!","10":"WEBTOON is definitely the app I would go to for comics that I love reading (on a daily basis). The WEBTOON authors are absolutely amazing and so is the app itself. At first there doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem with anything really. But the new policy for mature content is probably the main reason why I\u2019m only giving this a 3-star rating. I feel as if it doesn\u2019t seem fair for WEBTOON authors who love posting their comics on here feel less appreciated when their comics are taken down because of only a bit of NSFW content. Not only does it not seem fair it\u2019s also not letting the readers enjoy the authors comics and stories. The readers won\u2019t be able to look forward to the authors updates or comics because they were taken done for containing a bit of mature content. While, yes, it may be inappropriate for younger readers who have downloaded this app and wants to read\/enjoy comics online. Doesn\u2019t mean webtoons has to take down the whole comic because authors make sure either at the beginning (or towards the certain part of when the mature content is gonna start) of the update that there would contain mature content and to that extent the younger readers can skip the certain part and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about looking at something not fit for their age. Besides all this I\u2019m trying to clear the fact that the new policy is not right for the authors and readers who want to enjoy the content the authors post.","11":"Webtoon is the best app that u can read amazing free comics the authors are incredible!   And the so are the stories they wright and illustrate! I\u2019ve always loved it ! And always will BUT -_- ugh we all know THE NEW RULE!!! okay I understand webtoon is 9+ but have you seen some of the comics? ;-; there clearly 18+ and the new rule is making it hard for some Authors to continue their story\u2019s! And there having to go to Tapas(and some Authors can\u2019t) and the readers are also getting extremely mad at this rule and eventually webtoon is not gonna have 5 stars but 1 all were asking is to plz change the rule ! And we\u2019re all gonna end up happy and I know for a fact that webtoon knows about this problem and the angry readers like me writing this over and over again until eventually u fix this. and webtoon if u know about this why won\u2019t u fix it? Is it because maybe some kids find the 18+ comics and the parents write an angry complain about it? (First that\u2019s on the kids -_- if it says 18+ it\u2019s 18+) and maybe why u won\u2019t change the rule but hear me out just make webtoon 18+ and maybe it\u2019s not that simple and that\u2019s why u won\u2019t change it... but I will give webtoon 5 starts if u change this and so will everyone else Love u and always will! -_- till u change the new rule Love a reader who wants this to change.","12":"I seriously don\u2019t understand why Webtoon started this. When I was in school, this was my favorite app, but now I\u2019d rather not even bother. There\u2019s never an -all bad- change, but this isn\u2019t a great part of your change. Why would Someone wait one day at a time, to read chapters of stories that are sometimes just 20 words? That makes no sense. I\u2019d rather just not read them at all. Other people clearly feel this way. It took me a quick google search trying to understand why you began this daily pass thing, and it\u2019s all complaints sprinkled with some generalized understanding that winds up still being complaints! I used to spend more time on Webtoon, and was more willing to actually give money to support the app and my beloved authors and illustrators. I\u2019m overall fed up now. Most authors on Webtoon are posting their content on other comic sites anyways where this coin thing, does not exist.I\u2019d rather follow them on Instagram or somewhere else to show my support, then this app. So with all of this said, I\u2019m moving on to another app with comics that don\u2019t have this hassle. I\u2019m tired of companies becoming money hungry and destroying their already good product with money grab tactics. Maybe actually pay your content creators more, like they deserve. Most of your readers are younger, and do not have oodles of money to cough up for 20 words. I\u2019m really disappointed. Best of luck to you. It\u2019s been a good four years.","13":"This app was recommended from a friend and I tried it, and I was like WOW! This is amazing! I read this comic called True Beauty and I really recommend you to read it! The art was amazing and the story was really interesting! I literally speeded through like 86 episodes but then, on 87, it said I have to either pay 5 coins wich is 99 cents for wait a week! I don\u2019t have a credit card! Well, I don\u2019t have a credit card because I am 12, but still! I really liked the comic, so I waited a week and I watched it and then it said it AGAIN! I have to pay 5 coins or wait a week! I\u2019m sorry, but it just pisses me off to have such a good comic and then, I waited another week. When it came to the 3rd time, I swear, I could of flipped out! Overall, this app is ok. It\u2019s like any other app that tries to convince you that it\u2019s really good (wich it is) but then you have to pay more to keep getting the good stuff. It\u2019s just like any ordinary app trying to hook you and get money. But I just need the whole app to be freakin free! Is that to much to ask? If you don\u2019t have money in your credit card or don\u2019t even have a credit card and you don\u2019t want your heart to be crushed then do not get this app! If you have money in your credit card then I really recommend using this app! Especially the comic I was reading called True Beauty! The art is the best and the stories are really interesting! Thank you for listening to my review!","14":"Welp, here I go re editing my review from before for a second time. I love webtoon. The content it puts out is phenomenal and the app itself I find easy to use. However, one pro I always had for webtoon over any other comic app was that you didn\u2019t have to pay to read comics. I support the fast pass system(although my wallet hates me) because you\u2019re paying to read ahead. Kind of like crunchy roll where you pay to have premium and are able to not have to wait for new episodes. But now there\u2019s something I have an issue and that\u2019s called \u201cDaily Pass\u201d. This makes it so you can no longer binge read completed series without having to pay. Take Girls of Wilds for example. I started reading that before daily pass was a thing, made it to episode 15 before life hit me hard and I needed to take a break from a lot of stuff. I come back and it STOPS me at episode 15 and I can\u2019t go farther without paying coins or waiting for said Daily Pass. I think it\u2019s ridiculous how they\u2019ve changed. I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for over 2 years and I loved being able to read completed comics without having to worry about breaking the bank between updates. \n\nWebtoons I love you but I feel like you\u2019re really trying to milk readers of their money and that\u2019s not a good thing. If anything it\u2019s a slap in the face of the people who have supported you so much. You lost 2 stars from me.","15":"I literally go on this app so much to reread a comic or check for new ones. I\u2019ve been on here for almost four years and I\u2019m absolutely obsessed with it! I haven\u2019t paid for anything and I still enjoy it. There\u2019s only one thing I absolutely hate and it\u2019s the inappropriate replies to comments. The bots put them on almost any comment that doesn\u2019t have any replies yet, especially on more popular webtoons. I suggest just not allowing people to post links in the comments, as nobody needs them anyways :) but if you just report them and move on (NEVER go to the sites), then webtoon is amazing! I also suggest not using your coins (free or bought) on a webtoon with fast pass, because you\u2019ll have to either buy more coins and keep using them repeatedly (you literally have to spend for every chapter) or wait an extra week. Just use them on daily pass series :D  \nAlso about the daily pass series, I know a lot of people are complaining and I would also love to be able to go back on old stories, but I will say that it\u2019s better than waiting a week (your daily pass activates every 24 hours). It is a bit inconvenient like when I want to go back on a certain episode but forgot which it was (then I have to try every day), but it\u2019s not too bad <3\nthanks for reading!","16":"So, I really love Webtoon! I read everyday and always find new stories to read. The authors write so well and the events to get free coins are extremely convenient for people who aren\u2019t allowed to buy them  with money. Except.. I have two problems. My first problem is Daily pass for completed Webtoons. When I found out that Yumi\u2019s Cells was getting daily pass like other of my favorite completed Webtoons, I was really sad. I don\u2019t know if Webtoon understands that readers like to go back to their favorite completed stories.  Having to wait until 10:00pm everyday just to read two episodes kind of ruins the reading experience. Especially if the series you want to reread is longer than others. Sorry if I\u2019m rambling, I wanted to go in detail about my problems\ud83d\ude05my second problem is that my old Webtoon account was randomly deleted. So, I use my Apple ID fingerprint to sign into my account. One day, I had accidentally deleted Webtoon and when I downloaded it again and signed in, the app made me make a new account! So I lost all the stories I was reading and had to find them all over again. It doesn\u2019t really help because I mostly read Canvas stories. So, I hope that gets fixed. Over all, I love Webtoon and I spend so much time on it!","17":"I just found out about this today when I was going to go read Girls of the Wild. I also keep reading comments on Reddit about \u201csupporting the artists\u201d on multiple platforms and forums which are very irritating. No one is saying they don\u2019t want to support the artists or feel like they shouldn\u2019t have to. Literally no one is saying that at all when bringing up the real issue of these daily passes. \n\nWhat we are saying is that this feature and its functions are completely unreasonable. Girls of the Wild has 260 episodes and only 14 for free without daily passes. Which means you have to buy coins for 246 episodes. You would need over 1,000 coins and would be spending over $100 for a story you would once again have to purchase if you wanted to reread again after 14 days. Thats blatant robbery. \n\nYou can support the artist and also not get scammed at the same time. A one time ,fixed price would make more sense if this is the road they want to go down. We typically only make one time purchases for any other content we consume unless we are talking monthly subscriptions (my point is again proven with one time yearly subscriptions). What they are doing makes no sense and is obviously driven by greed. Anyone can see that and we aren\u2019t wrong for not being ok with it or speaking out on it. You can find a way to support the artists and not rip off your readers at the same time.","18":"I was looking through the comments and many people are complaining about the New policy. For new people looking to download: basically the new policy just bans any inappropriate content since the app is supposed to be for 9+. Which is pretty dumb since most comics have cuss words in them. I happen to work at a daycare that have kids of all ages, and let me just say that 9 year olds are NOT innocent. (Trust me. They know things that they probably shouldn\u2019t know yet.) While it is true that i think the New Policy is a bit questionable, it does not affect that much. The comics are still great. The authors love doing what they do. There is always something new to read every single day. I have been reading Webtoon for a couple of years now and it is probably one of the best apps I have ever downloaded. It gave me one hell of a rollercoaster ride. I laughed with Benny. I cried and ate Marmalade. My heart pounded with Shin-Ae. I gushed over Lumine. I got angry with Daniel. I signed the petition for John to stop gelling his hair. I fangirled over Baam. I get hungry with Lucy. I played the game with Dongtae. And I even shouted at my phone many times over the amount of cliffhangers that practically kill you. This platform leaves you with so many emotions. I definitely recommend downloading it.","19":"Ok I absolutely adore this app. I have found so many amazing series that I have grown to love on here. But seriously guys I get the creators need to make money but daily pass is not the way to do that ( at least in my and apparently quite a few others opinions) not only does it ruin the whole experience for a lot of people, those who aren\u2019t willing or simply cannot spend the extra money, but it just feels soo... cash-grabby like I said I get that they need to make money but why not like have ads or something else and just make a fee to remove them I know people wouldn\u2019t like it but they sure wouldn\u2019t dislike it more than daily pass. Also I\u2019m pretty sure this doesn\u2019t only hurt readers but the creators to like I know that I personally have walked away from quite a few interesting comics because I realized that there was a daily pass on them ( I read quite quickly so being forced to go a day at a time really bugs me) and I\u2019m sure many others have as well. And if a bunch of people decide not to read the comics then doesn\u2019t that cause the writer to suffer? Anyway this is a great app and I\u2019m sure the creators who have consistently been understanding and listened to fan out cry will take into consideration the overwhelming negative reaction to daily pass and ,please for goodness sakes please, come up with a new solution.","20":"Now, I consider myself to be fairly new to WEBTOON, but not to where I haven\u2019t heard of the policy. The policy where comics that have NSFW content in it aren\u2019t allowed to be posted in WEBTOON. I think it\u2019s pretty ridiculous (but that\u2019s my own opinion) because that means that some WEBTOON creators are forced to keep their hard work contained because of NSFW content. Instead of overall getting rid of NSFW content, maybe something could be installed to categorize age restrictions, or something of the sort. It could maybe be something that parents install, OR maybe something that is installed on it\u2019s own! I\u2019m sure a lot of WEBTOON creators are angry that this has happened...but let\u2019s just hope that this can be resolved. Now, with that to the side, I was addicted from the start when I got this app. The first few times I saw ads for it, I just ignored them. I would maybe stare at an ad for a few seconds, considering to download it, but then move on. But...when I found the ad and finally clicked on it...I decided to download the app! And I\u2019m so glad I did, too! My favorite series right now include Lumine, Blue Chair, True Beauty, and a lot more! I have read a ton of little skits along with dramatic plot stories. Overall, besides the new policy, I\u2019m really grateful I decided to download WEBTOON.","21":"I love this app. I love joe easy it is to read comics and I just love the different types of conics! It\u2019s just amazing bc of this I have something to look forward to every single night. But I have some suggestions! Webtoon  I understand u must pay to get fast past coins  and I love how cheap they are! But I feel as though for some of us who don\u2019t have the ability to get coins I feel as thought you should give us more options on actually GETTING coins. Noticing how you are beginning to use videos I was thinking if you watching a certain amount of videos then you would get 5 coins or less and that\u2019s it for the whole week. Also I do have a single complaint which actually is about the videos!\nI\u2019ve noticed that the dont work all the time. This happens every single time I get a video I love I get to read early but please fix this!\nAnyways I love the app! It\u2019s truly become something I truly enjoy I love this app! But please take my suggestion and for those who don\u2019t have the current ability to buy coins try to make more ways for people who CANT buy them a way to get a few it would really be nice. I\u2019m not sure if you will read this I honestly doubt it but, take my suggestion and again ty for this wonderful app. \nTy","22":"I love this app, because sometimes I get tire or fall asleep on a book\ud83d\udcd6 in front of my hands, by just reading some boring words, but that\u2019s ok for me or for others... BUT~ the most that I like to read is this app, because u could c those images n texts, also u read with others by doing a voice over or by yrself or little by little read on yr mind by pretending; like hearing dffnt voice of a person. It\u2019s like u watch of a cartoons or movie shows n then u catch some other person voice by hear of what their voice sound like, n then while u r reading this webtoon story, u may hear another voice of a dffnt person in yr mind,\u2026while u still reading. Sometimes I read this app for my little brother; for bedtime, cause he like it too. Also u could comments n likes, or download some single page of the stories, or others. \u2757\ufe0fAlmost forgot to say something else, when u r done reading the hole story\u2019s n u want to read next, u have to wait for few days, if u don\u2019t want to wait, u must buy some coins n then use those coins to pay for the next story. \nI like to wait, cuz I have some time to do other things, when the day comes n the new update story page came out, I have time to read more!\n*\uff65\u309c\uff9f\uff65*:.\uff61..\uff61.:*\uff65'(*\uff9f\u25bd\uff9f*)'\uff65*:.\uff61. .\uff61.:*\uff65\u309c\uff9f\uff65*","23":"This app is fantastic, there are so many talented creators and interesting comics to read, and the occasional coin event is a great idea for those not willing to pay. On that note, the Daily Pass system is a really unfortunate development that harms authors and readers more than helps. The fact that you need to pay to access past episodes rather than future ones (Fast Pass, which is great) is a poor strategy, as the app is mostly frequented by teens without bank accounts of their own, and others might just not think it\u2019s worth it. Authors end up losing readers because the people who want to read something they\u2019ve read before or a newly featured completed series have to pay money or restrict themselves to one episode per day, which is an unsatisfying reading experience if they plan to binge. \n\nTwo examples of incredible stories that use the Daily Pass are \u201cPigpen\u201d by one of the arguably best authors on the site, and \u201cRefund High School\u201d, a widely read and loved fantasy. They are both complete, but now require a Daily Pass per episode after 8 or so, taking the possibility of re-reading or binging the entire series\u2019 - I was lucky enough to be able to read \u201cRefund High School\u201d as the episodes were still coming out, but I know others weren\u2019t and will miss out on the charming story and gorgeous art.","24":"I love this app, it brings me so much joy and happy vibes. I got it almost a year ago, and it's now become one of my favorite ways to relax and just step away from life for a sec. I personally have a few problemos sometimes though. Daily pass came recently, and it means that stories that have been completed have a daily episode for you, when you used to be able to binge read them. You can buy coins and then binge read, but me being the broke teenager I am, cannot do this *sad boi vibes intensifies*. I totally understand that webtoon needs to make money somehow, given the fact that it is a free app of happiness, but it's still a Debby downer with the binge taken away. Also, sometimes the app will glitch and log me out, not letting me log in again until I restart my phone, and sometimes it will tell my I have multiple devices logged in (? I only use my phone for webtoon) and it won't let me do stuff like daily pass or anything involving coins\ud83d\ude2d. But overall amazing app, and if I could rate 4.9 I would, but things have to be said so I rated it a 4. But yeah, A+ entertainment. Go download it for your own good childe. Go now.","25":"I have had webtoon for a long time now and it\u2019s an amazing app with many creative artists, they recently added passes to webtoon which you can unlock with coins which of course you have to buy\nI don\u2019t at all mind the fast pass feature they added, even though I myself can\u2019t buy coins it is a good feature for making money but I do have to say that I am not so much a fan of using coins to unlock chapters on completed webtoons. For example \u201cBastard\u201d I wanted to go back and read the webtoon after so long, I always was cut on time and got dragged in with other webtoons so I never got the chance to finish reading it. Now I do have lots of time on my hands but it\u2019s a shame that I can\u2019t read all of it at once anymore. I only get a free pass for a chapter, as someone who can\u2019t afford to buy coins it\u2019s not the best in my opinion, I was doing ok without that feature but if it is still going to be in the app I recommend making at least 4-5 chapters free each day so some of us that cannot get coins can still enjoy parts of the story at once rather then just 2. Overall I still love the app it has so many lovely stories and it\u2019s just amazing, I do experience a few bugs here and there but nothing too bad.","26":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for some time now and it\u2019s been great. I\u2019ve loved the stories and art styles that the authors have come up with- but I\u2019ve gotten onto it recently and it keeps acting up. When I click on a story it won\u2019t load and sometimes doesn\u2019t even take my clicks, taking forever to load. It kind of like freezes and won\u2019t do anything until a while later. When it does finally do something it takes forever to load and I\u2019m not that patient. Another problem is that whole daily pass thing going on- if it\u2019s a way for the author to still make money out of their completed stories then I guess I can\u2019t really be upset, but it is a bit annoying since I want to reread some of my favorite webcomics( one of them being Bastard). Anyways, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I still really enjoy this app and I hope the issue doesn\u2019t last forever.\nEdit- I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. And now I can\u2019t get back in. I paid for coins. I either want my money back or it transferred to a possible new account. Also, I\u2019ve made a new account- it too is acting up really badly. This is honestly awful. I really liked this app and now I might as well delete it.\nEdit 2-  I managed to get back into my old account!!!!! :) unfortunately, still acting a mess","27":"I love Webtoon!! It\u2019s very nice and I like the artistry. I really enjoy reading the comics. I\u2019m pretty sure people don\u2019t like the fact that their is fast pass, but waiting for a week is worth it I guess. \nJust waiting for that one episode from your favorite comic is worth it. I\u2019m really glad that you guys made fast pass though. Some people should be grateful for even getting to read the episodes for free, because some of the other apps that have comics only have a few free episodes, and than you have to pay for the rest.. I\u2019m glad that I can have a nice day just reading episodes that are free!! It\u2019s rare to find an app like this, with free episodes. And I know that some people are complaining about the cliffhangers, but don\u2019t the artists work hard just for us to read it? BE glad that you can just read free episodes!! Plus if fast pass wasn\u2019t here, we would be having to wait for a whole entire week, I\u2019m fine with that though. They just want you guys to enjoy it!! Be happy that we even have an app like this. Some other people use fast pass so they can read more though!! I don\u2019t think this topic even matters though but I\u2019m just saying.. I also don\u2019t wanna start controversy.","28":"Since 2015 I have read webtoons on my phone and loved it; however, recently the app seems to take forever to load up the screen and I have to constantly open and close the app just to finally have one of the titles appear. I no longer can even see anything under the \u201cMy\u201d tab. Up until about a month ago perhaps, everything has been running smoothly and I have loved the app, but for every time I open the app and it to have issues even pulling up a webtoon, it is getting frustrating to the point where I do not even want to go on it daily to read the daily uploads as it just takes forever. \n\nI have had no complaints about how this app runs up until recently and I just hope it gets fixed so I can give the app the 5 stars it would deserve otherwise.\n\n(PS though, it is really annoying that we can not go back and read old titles without the daily pass, because I was on the app when these titles were being posted and I believe that wait was enough. We should be able yo go back and read them without needing to get \u201cdaily passes.\u201d An app such as this should look forward to building up the amount of titles they currently have completed, not try to earn money off of what they already did from previous readers.)","29":"I absolutely love webtoon. So many good stories to read and fall in love with. It\u2019s a great platform. When fast pass was introduced I was completely ok with it. If I choose I can read ahead and if not then i\u2019m satisfied waiting for the weekly episodes. What goes through my mind is that when these comics finish I want to read it all in once sitting to get the full effect of the story. I also love going back and re reading old stories that i\u2019ve already read. Then daily pass was introduced and that is where I became really unhappy with the app. I love rereading stories and binge reading and now I can\u2019t even go back and read without waiting all over again. An example is A Good Day to be a Dog. I have been following this story for a while and have been reading it once a week patiently waiting for the next eps. I was hoping once it finished to read it as a whole instead of week by week. When it finally finished I noticed that i couldn\u2019t binge read the whole thing and had to wait all over again. I\u2019m just really disappointed that I had to wait for the story to finish and now I had to wait again to reread it. I feel like webtoon is slowly turning into an app that wants money more and more and it makes me very sad. I really hope they get rid of the Daily Pass.","30":"ok so i love this app and i usually use it every day but i opened the app yesterday and it logged me out for no reason. I thought \u201coh this again ok i\u2019ll just sign in with the password saved on my phone\u201d but i put in my email and password and it didn\u2019t work! It said my email wasn\u2019t registered (even though it was) and wouldn\u2019t log me in. I tried doing this online too and it didn\u2019t work so I tried resetting my password and it didn\u2019t work, so I thought maybe it\u2019s wifi issues and waited till the next day and it still was the same. So i just decided to screen record all of my recent webtoons so i can make a new account, subscribe and go to each episode i was on and i tried to use the email from my last account but it said it was registered already-  I don\u2019t know what to do! This has never happened before and someone said i could be banned but i never wrote any comments that would be offensive to anyone! I barely even write comments. It\u2019s a shame that i might lose all my fast passes but at least i didn\u2019t have any coins at the moment. I wrote 5 stars because I do love this app but I need this to get to the top so someone can help me! Please help!","31":"I absolutely love webtoon. I have had this app for a couple of months and it has been keeping me busy! I started reading \u201ctrue beauty\u201d and \u201cthe little trashmaid.\u201d Then of course that wasn\u2019t enough so I began reading \u201cLore Olympus\u201d! These are all series I highly recommend. I also decided I wanted to make a WEBTOON myself, so i did. (It\u2019s called \u201cmass Psychopath\u201d if you wanna read \ud83d\ude09.) WEBTOON makes it extremely easy to publish your series and episodes. However it isn\u2019t available on phone to publish series so keep that in mind. I got a lot of views fast so if you are wanting to publish a comic with like no budget, WEBTOON is definitly for you. Of course you can use photoshop to make your eps but I would suggest to do it for free then upgrade to photoshop or some sort of drawing tool after your series is getting you money. I also reccomend ibisPaint to make your episodes. All in all, this app has given me happiness that I hadn\u2019t ever experienced before (but don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t have depression thank golly) anyway! Definitly download if you like anime (even if you don\u2019t like anime still download because it has stories that don\u2019t have anime style drawings) or comics.","32":"First things first, this app is fantastic. If you don\u2019t have time to get ABSOLUTELY HOOKED, I\u2019m warning you now.\n\nThere seems to be an unlimited supply of beautifully written, skillfully drawn comics\/stories to dive into.   I\u2019ve seen this app advertised to me many times, and after downloading it for the first time two weeks ago, it\u2019s become an obsession! I initially downloaded it because of one story, but after getting current with it, I kept looking for more. And now I\u2019m scrolling my way through six different amazing series! I\u2019m a sucker for drama and romance and there are so many options. You can click a room based on the name\/title\/ratings, read one chapter and decide if you like it. If not, there\u2019s plenty more to choose from! This app really shines a spotlight on all the creative and talented storytellers, artists, AND musicians in this world. With each new chapter an artists puts out, you can\u2019t help but admire the hard work and dedication that goes into not only telling a great story, but drawing it, and making it believable. Tons of respect for these individuals. You\u2019ll definitely find something worth spending money on too, so beware.","33":"So I\u2019ve been using Webtoon for two, three years now. It\u2019s a fantastic app, it\u2019s amazing to see other people\u2019s art and stories, and how well put together they are! The app itself is fantastic and has a great team that not only support readers, but authors\/artists themselves. However, a recent update was the \u201cfast pass\u201d I have never purchased one, because frankly, it\u2019s a waste of money. I feel that it\u2019s slightly annoying, and it doesn\u2019t feel like old Webtoon anymore. The app could have improved if they didn\u2019t add it, or would take it out. It\u2019s a real annoyance when other apps do this, because not everyone is able to collaborate anymore with everyone else, and the person who posted a comment for a comic that was supposed to go on July 3rd gets to see it on June 12th, thus making the reply section useless. It\u2019s a ridiculous feature, and the app was perfectly fine without it. I also really dislike the new \u201cdaily pass\u201d. Why would you make a good app have a daily pass? I can\u2019t enjoy the completed titles I like now. What\u2019s gonna happen next, I have to pay to read the newest episode? I have to pay for EVERYTHING, and it\u2019s really not great. I recommend getting the app, but if you don\u2019t wanna pay the worlds worth of money, don\u2019t get it.","34":"I loved this app and I\u2019ve been reading WEBTOON a for very long time. One thing I love is the ability to reread complete series. With the new \u201cdaily pass\u201d update it limits this. The weird part is, is that it\u2019s not even on every complete WEBTOON, only a select few... I\u2019m not sure how the money works in this situation but I don\u2019t like the system.... finished WEBTOONs should be open to read just as all the big name webtoons are open so you can catch up. The reason why WEBTOON is doing so well is because it\u2019s completely free, I saw many other reviews and noticed that many people are upset with this. I wanted to read Orange Marmalade but now with this system, a read that would take me a day will now take 2 months unless I want to spend money. I love WEBTOON but I think this system is extremely flawed, I enjoy the fast pass system because it is designed in a way to give us readers a choice. At least when you unlock an episode using the daily pass, make it unlocked forever so that we only have to go through it once. I think it\u2019s ridiculous to wait 2 months over and over if you really enjoy a series :\/ pls take my advice, I\u2019m sure many others would agree.","35":"Ok imma just be honest.... why is WEBTOON anime and ramen literally the best combo ever.\nLike I could like off of those thing plus necessary needs like a house with air conditioning and a heater ya know. But frl that is like my dream life right there. To be honest idk why people complain about the daily pass, like bro u don\u2019t even have to wait a full 24hrs. And it\u2019s like totally worth it plus, it\u2019s not like you can only read one WEBTOON a day. You can read as many as you\u2019d like especially if you have coins which WEBTOON also occasionally gives out free coins to it\u2019s logged in users. Soooo take it from a professional web and if u like reading funny, horror, thriller, romance, etc. graphic novels u should download WEBTOON. I mean it\u2019s free and u don\u2019t even have to log into it t read but it\u2019s not like it cost anything if you do... but word of advice my little sister logged in and put in the wrong year for being able to type and read comments (\u2018cause some people are inappropriate and rude with comments) and she couldn\u2019t get to the comments sooooo unless u don\u2019t care about comments it doesn\u2019t really matter but the acceptance age is 13 so good luck and I hope u enjoy. \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08","36":"Honestly WEBTOON is a great app and I enjoy all the stories on there. Well, that was before WEBTOON\u2019s new NSFW policy. The new policy is ruining my reading experience because authors are having chapters and episodes taken down and it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s the responsibility of the reader to not read obviously mature content and if a warning is needed then WEBTOON should have a policy where authors have a warning in the description. It\u2019s not reasonable to take down content and force authors to heavily censor their work when it\u2019s the reader\u2019s choice whether to read the mature content or not and it\u2019s negatively affecting other people\u2019s reading experience, people who enjoy the NSFW content. Instead of ruining people\u2019s reading experience with this new policy, I suggest just having a mandatory mature content warning in the description or adding a choice for authors to have a mature content warning to the app. And if an author does not add the warning but still has mature content then you may take down the content or suspend their account or story until they do. This way everyone knows what they\u2019re in for when reading a story and cannot complain about not knowing while also not ruining other readers\u2019 experience. Please consider this idea because no one, including myself, is liking this new policy and it needs to be either removed or replaced with something better to give people the best reading experience.","37":"What I love about Webtoon is the stories you will find not to mention the authors. Most authors tried to interact with their readers as much as they can, whether it\u2019s Uru-Chan who keeps us update at the end of each episode for UnOrdinary or Sandra who post fan arts her fans make on her Supersonic Girl Webtoon. There are really kind people on Webtoon. Then you have authors like Shen and Fishball who answer questions asked by their readers. There are really kind people on Webtoon. At times, even the readers can be supportive. When an author is hurt or ill and mentions it, in the comments section the common comments is \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Get well soon!\u201d Other then the people, the stories are amazing. There are talented people on Webtoon. There are many things learn from different Webtoons. I find myself looking the funny moments in Webtoons. I also like how Webtoon gives others a chance to create their own Webtoon. It\u2019s also known as Discover, and there you can find works done by inspired people. And they are actually read by the same viewers. It\u2019s a good start to share your story. There\u2019s a lot of collaboration in Webtoon which I like. It shows you how close the Authors are.","38":"Hello! I am an award winning creator of the webtoon \ud558\ub4dc\uac1c\ub9ac (No Scope on this release) from South Korea and I did want to leave a review saying I really enjoy reading these international comics when I\u2019m in America. I would say that overall this is the best comic app I\u2019ve seen that produces international content from Korea, and in Korea it is considered the most popular and most legitimate digital publication app. Apps like Lezhin try to advertise their content, but this is the best selection of diverse and quality content I have ever seen! The reading format is very smooth on old to new phones (I have been reading on the US app since 2016), and there is so much potential in the creator base here. While the overseas translations aren\u2019t always amazing, I do love seeing some of the award winning Korean comics making their way here! Originals like UnOrdinary would be given high praise by Korean people who can read English. I personally enjoy a lot of the serialized stories, but the availability of slice of life and meme comics like Bluechair are great to have. All in all it is a great international release chapter of the original Korean webtoon app, and I enjoy seeing comics from Indonesia here as well!","39":"I absolutely love webtoon but the new update just makes reading comics less enjoyable. Earlier I went to my subscribed list and went to re read one of my favorite webtoons that had been finished since 2018. When I pulled it up I found out that I couldn\u2019t read it without having to pay. This mad me really sad because me being 16, I can\u2019t afford to pay for 100+ chapters, especially if I have already read them. It would be nice to be able to go back and read my favorites and enjoy them. This probably also affects new readers a lot as well. Imagine someone recommending you a webtoon and you go to read it and you have to wait or pay for episodes that have been out for years . I have bought fast passes before but I feel like renting a chapter for 14 days is stupid. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love supporting the authors so I don\u2019t wanna hate on something that supports them. I know that many of the creators have Merchandise or have made money off fast passes or adds on their comics so I feel like 14 day pass just isn\u2019t the vibe. I know that most people who read on the app are young and can\u2019t afford to read using the 14 day pass. I just want webtoon to go back to being the safe place where my broke self can read and enjoy comics.","40":"I love this app. The more you use the it the more you\u2019ll start to like it. I go on it everyday. The only problem I have with it is that it\u2019s sooooo protected. Like, if you tap on a webtoon that is a little explicit, it gives us a warning, right? I personally find that warning unnecessary because you guys always remove the stuff that go over kissing. It should be fine if it doesn\u2019t show any personal parts, right? But this stuff is wayyy too protected. It\u2019s actually starting to get me angry. I don\u2019t really mind buying coins and stuff since it\u2019s just a one time offer thing, but you guys make make want to buy Patreon, and it only applies to the webtoon I apply for AND I have to pay for it every month. Ain\u2019t nobody got the money for Patreon dude. Literally no one. Plus, a good 80% of the webtoons I like aren\u2019t even on Tapas, so I end up just getting cut off scenes which really gets on my nerves. I\u2019m of course fine if you clean it up a bit, but the least you can do is censor the scenes instead of remove them. Some really important drama happens in those scenes too, you know? So it leaves you a little confused on the story afterwards. So I definitely think that part should be improved a bit more.","41":"Webtoon is  a good ap for finding and reading comics. It's simple to navigate, easy on the eyes. and has a genuinely kind community besides the spam accounts vomiting links in comments sections. It would be nice to have more sorting options and be able to have a reading list that you can set to public. I would give this app 4 out of 5 stars, but I have some qualms with Webtoon on the iPad: \n1. The app interface isn't compatible with screen rotation. Constantly swithing between landscape and portrait and holding iPads in portrait mode (depending on the case you have) doesn't make for very smooth reading. You can't just flick those thinks like you can with phones, and a lot of foldable cases only stand in landscape mode.\n2. Constant. Crashing.  I am mot the only person I know experiencing this, and this isn't exclusive to one type of iPad. Standard iPads, iPad Pro, iPad Air... How has this gone unnoticed for so long and throughout so many updates? It works fine until you start reading. Go to the next page, you realize you can't scroll anymore, and the app closes. Sometimes it only happens every few pages, but it's a gamble and is the main reason I can't say it is worthy of a fourth star.\nThis concludes my revie.","42":"Ok first I\u2019m going to talk about my experience with webtoon. Great authors, and endless amount to read and enjoy. Would\u2019ve been a five star content if hadn\u2019t been for this update and policy I\u2019ve been seeing. Ever since an update of some sort, I\u2019ve been experiencing weird scams popping up when I read stories. It automatically directs me to safari with a \u201cfree iPhone, spin me\u201d type of thing. What is this. No. Please fix it, it\u2019s annoying right now. I can barely get through seeing the authors panel without running into a random scam. I mean I\u2019m completely fine with you adding ads on the bottom of each episode, but this gotta go. And lastly my concern about this new policy I\u2019ve been hearing from some authors. It\u2019s completely unreasonable. Sure there are some kids who shouldn\u2019t be influenced by this but you placed an 18+ yes or no question up, so it is not the authors fault for having to ruin their hobby and readers. It\u2019s not like kids these days are being sheltered on technology like cmon it\u2019s unavoidable. Might as well not let the whole lot have to feel unhappy. And especially when you stop an author\u2019s work midway. Wish you guys could think out of the box but now that I see this policy going into place, it only makes me wonder if review is even needed. -.-","43":"Look, I used to love this app, but recently all my favorite webtoons that have been completed are being converted to daily pass. I understand that the creators are still able to profit of it because of daily pass, but I feel like there are better ways to do this. I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to watching a few ads to read an episode or something like that. The beauty of completed webtoons is that you can binge them all in a short period of time, but when they are all becoming daily pass, you don\u2019t get to do that without spending way more money than you would be willing to. I also really don\u2019t like how after you use a daily pass, the episode you unlocked is only available for 14 days. If I need to go back and look at an episode because later it has a call back, I don\u2019t want to have to use a daily pass or spend coins. I actually like the completed section more than weekly updates, because reading an entire series at once is way more engaging than having to wait a week for one more episode. I will continue to support Webtoon creators, but I\u2019m still very upset that it will take a long long time to reread some of my favorite webtoons just because of daily passes.","44":"I HATE THE DAILY LIMIT. Terrible. Makes me so mad and this is totally getting me sooo mad. \n\nOtherwise...this app is absolutely a time killer and a fun time for readers to read online stories. So many options! I love reading but I haven\u2019t found any. I saw an add probably a couple months ago and decided to get this app. It has had no glitches or that. I saw another ones report as a glitch happened, but yes it does happen rarely. This game is amazing and I go on it when I possible can. Amazing stories and cute art, absolutely awesome. Not a better book then this I could EVER find. This is the best app for reading in my life, and i do have to wait long times for next episodes but then I find another book. I prefer signing in or logging in to an account to comment, subscribe, and bookmark your books you read. Definitely a great game to get. Books I would reccomend are True Beauty, Swimming lessons for a mermaid, Big Joe, And love me knot. A lot more aweosme stories are there, but those are mine I LOVE. All of them have enticing love triangles, obstacles in life, and goals. All realistic, and amazing art. \nThanks for reading this.\nJust remember you will get so so mad at the daily limit.","45":"I like the app but it really upset me when I read 100 episodes of Tower to God and I got the you finished whole thing but when I go back on to see if I got my 5 coins I got nothing I checked if my thing was updated it\u2019s completely updated so now I read 100 episodes and got nothing I\u2019m a fast reader so this didn\u2019t take much of my time to accomplish just 2 days but still I could have been doing other stuff rather than thinking I was going to get a reward when really I got nothing and that thing for the reward even said you would get your coins on 12\/23 soooo I\u2019m disappointed because other than this I have no problems and I really like the app but this deeply upsets me because I\u2019ve had this app for a few years now and I used to have it on my tablet but then I switched it to my phone and got a different account but after everything I\u2019ve gone through with this app I thought it would be a little more carful with just telling people they would get something but not getting it maybe it was my fault in some way but I\u2019m still very upset about this other than this ordeal I love the app and the story\u2019s are well written and you can have a few story\u2019s coming out everyday","46":"This is an amazing app not gonna lie.. but when there are these little events of getting free coins if you read the stories, I have tried it. And when I finished it said to collect the coins that I earned and then the screen froze. So I left and got back in, i went to my favorite series and I wanted to buy a free pass to see the next episode instead of waiting. Then it said so I can go to the shop to get coins, I was very confused and went to the shop to see if I got the free 5 coins from the event thing. And I didn\u2019t have any.... that was kind of a waste of my time to read other stories that I am not interested in just to get nothing from it. It is a very good app with interesting parts of the story you are reading, there are many different kinds but I did get scammed a bit to getting free coins and now I don\u2019t have the coins and I guess I need to wait longer for another thing to happen so I can participate for coins. I hope the creators of WEBTOON see this and to not make my screen freeze after I get free coins ;-; or maybe what will be a bit better so I can just get it and not wait for another event to happen in like a week or something.","47":"About a month ago my app completely glitched and 1) ALL MY 100+ COINS JUST DISAPPEARED and all the fast pass comics I had already unlocked were locked again and 2) all my subscriptions disappeared and reverted to my subscription list from 2016 (consisting of Webtoons that have been done for years).\n\nI reached out to Webtoons immediately after it happened and after 2 weeks of silence I had to go digging on the the internet for A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CORPORATE EMAIL to get someone to email me back. They said \u201cwe\u2019ll look into it\u201d and left it at that. It\u2019s been another 2 weeks since then and there hasn\u2019t been any talk about the money I lost. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be understanding of the Corona circumstances but a month is a little ridiculous. I don\u2019t think this is a normal occurrence and I wouldn\u2019t be pressed if it was just the subscriptions, but it was almost $15 worth of coins just poof. Gone. And it\u2019s starting to feel impossible to get them back. I\u2019ve been using the Webtoons app for over 4 years now and I\u2019d love to just give the app 5 stars and call it a day because it has brought me so much joy (that\u2019s why I won\u2019t give it 1 star), but such a simple problem is taking so long to solve and I feel like I\u2019ve been robbed. Please I just want my coins back \ud83d\ude1e","48":"So I love WEBTOON but when I want to read the latest episode it either will cost me money or make me wait something crazy like 22 days and also webtoon should make a child friendly version or a child lock mode so kids when I say kids I mean 6-10 can read comics to and fix bugs.\n\nI remember when it was (if you read my dear cold blooded king you would know) free to read the latest episode. I got up on Sunday morning and ate breakfast then read the episode before I found webtoon I always watched Netflix. I love webtoon and it deserves support but \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb to fast passes because (I know webtoon is trying to make money) they aren\u2019t needed (make a premium we can purchase for exclusive content like a membership and for authors or whatever you want to call them you could have special things for them on the premium like featuring there comics and maybe for premium authors there could be an early release and to people who have the premium will get an extra early release (please take out fast pass it is the most annoying thing I have ever seen and also maybe you could do my ideas?))","49":"First of all let me start off by saying I love WEBTOON I think it\u2019s a great app. Because you can read great comics for free unlike any other comic app. But recently there have been or are going to be some changes and I don\u2019t agree with . 1st of all I don\u2019t really believe that the majority of your audience are nine year olds or younger. So why do you have to remove or not allow mature content and even if they are it\u2019s not like someone forces them to read it they choose to read it. I know because every time you open a story that is BL or anything mature they specifically state content is for mature audiences\/ for anyone of 19 years or older. Another thing if you are going to get offended do not report it just stop reading it. You can\u2019t be offended if your the one that chose to open it. You CAN NOT say \u201cWell I wasn\u2019t warned\u201d or some other bs because that is the reason there is a description. I don\u2019t agree that the audiences or the authors should have to suffer because of other people's opinions  or issues. It\u2019s the 21st-century you can get over it. And yes I know that it\u2019s inappropriate content but again there are restrictions in place so why does that have to change. I personally feel like I\u2019m speaking for all the people that are unset because of this change and idc what people say it\u2019s just my opinion your entitled to yours thank you.","50":"I love this app, it\u2019s gotta be one of my most used apps due to all of the comics on it. The comics are fun to read, there are next to none ads, except for the ones at the bottom of the comics but they\u2019re barely noticeable, the layout is great and easy to navigate, and they do a lot of cool stuff like giveaways. There\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t like unfortunately, it\u2019s the new daily pass system. The daily pass system makes it harder and way less fun to read all of the finished or completed comics since you have to wait a day to read one chapter. I loved reading completed comics because there was no wait and I could read 20-30 chapters in a sitting but now I have to wait a day to read one. I know this is a small minuscule thing to complain about since you have to wait an entire week for a comic to come out but the daily pass takes away the fun in completed and classic comics. Other than that one thing that I don\u2019t like that I dragged on about as if it was the worst thing that could ever happen to me, the app is amazing and so are the comics. Alright, I\u2019m gonna go re-read Tower of God. Bye, and thanks for reading I guess...","51":"To be 100% honest I loved WEBTOON before they created to new policy about mature content. WEBTOON is there own company so I\u2019m not sure if they will even care about this opinion but for me at least I have already seen so many creators that I loved reading grow to get frustrated by this new policy. I know that I\u2019m just one person but I thought I should still share this thought in the hopes the company will see this. I used to love getting a notification for a new comic from WEBTOON but now I\u2019m scared to open the app because there is a chance another creator has decided that they don\u2019t want to use this app anymore because the new policy frustrated them. I\u2019m not trying to speak for everyone I\u2019m only speaking for my self and I apologize to the company for giving a low review like this I usually don\u2019t do this but today another WEBTOON that I loved decided to leave this app and it made me frustrated and thought I had to at least try to do something. Once again WEBTOON is a company so they are allowed to do what they want with there product but it still is very frustrating and I might just delete the app entirely. If anyone read this thanks for dealing with my small rant but just the hope of WEBTOON seeing this and maybe make a change was enough for me.","52":"I genuinely love Webtoon so much. I started using it a little over a year ago, but wasn\u2019t as obsessed as I am now until quarantine started. I read about 40 Webtoons at this point and love having something to look forward to every week. There are some amazing authors on this app. Fast pass is kind of a bummer since personally I can not afford to pay every week and only people who use fast pass can get top comments, and there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of \u201cFAST PASS GANG WHERE YOU AT\u201d comments, but I understand that it helps support the authors. Still wish there was another way to get coins, like watching ads or something, because I would 100% do that, but fast pass does not by any means hurt my love of Webtoon. Another thing I should mention is there aren\u2019t any ad pop ups (the ones for those weird mobile games, you probably know what I\u2019m talking about). There\u2019s only a small ad at the end of each episode usually and I am very happy about this. Pop ups are annoying asl. This was a bit of a rant but all in all Webtoon is great, and I  highly recommend downloading it!!","53":"So I\u2019m a high school student who reads these as a treat after I finish summer\/ school work and the majority of the time I\u2019m reading the already released ones, finishing the whole story in at least a week. But with this new daily pass I have to wait every day to read a already released series that has been free sense it\u2019s finish. I love this app but if they are making it so I have to buy coins to see the episodes they shouldn\u2019t put a clock on it, bc if I already bought it then I shouldn\u2019t have to buy it again if I want to read it again after the 14 days are up. And to someone like me who doesn\u2019t really have a whole lot of money its really discouraging bc I love these storys so much but I\u2019m not going to spend tons of real money just to read them if they where free, and completed, before this feature was even a thing. And I know there\u2019s coin events but that still doesn\u2019t account for that amount of money I would have to spend in order to read these story\u2019s as much as I would like to. Please change this back to the way it was! I know that quarantine is hard but after the app has made there money back I think that they should get rid of this frustrating feature!","54":"Webtoons has many comics in multiple languages, obviously I'm an english speaker though, and even though Webtoons debuted in Korean there are a LOT of english webcomics. The webcomics don't fall into the stereotypical story lines or sexist storylines most of the time like I've seen on low grade webcomic apps. Everything is free to read but there is fast pass which will let you read up to 3 episodes ahead if you use coins to unlock fast pass. There are a decent amount of LGBT+ comics (I suggest Muted and Mage and Demon Queen). Theres no actual nsfw stuff too other than kissing really, whether you find that good or bad. There are many genres with a Webtoon Canvas (user submitted) section and a Webtoon Originals section (webcomics thats Webtoon basically pays the comic artist and works with them for) along with all the other genres like drama, romance, action, fantasy, thriller, etc. I have no complaints about Webtoon, the comics are good and diverse, the paid features are very unobtrusive and are implemented in a very non annoying way, and everything is free. I have been using Webtoons for 2 years now and love it. 10\/10","55":"I LOVE this app. the sheer number of stories and diversity in stories is awesome! I can read a Bl series right after a thriller and be satisfied with both. I am a reader, but love how authors are being paid for their art. art is hard. and artists dream is to be paid enough to become a full time artist, and this app makes dreams come true. there are so many ways to support our favorite creators, with daily pass, the new add feature on canvas, ads, views, patreon, and originals. and thanks to supported artists, us readers get more things to read faster! i understand artists need support so sometimes i go out of my way to buy coins just to support the author, and personally think that this app should keep the in app purchases. the only slight downside is the daily pass for completed series, but even those seem a bit reasonable. One last thing, sometimes the app doesn\u2019t want to open after some updates, so i have to wait a full day for it to work, reinstalling the app doesn\u2019t work, nor does powering off my phone, if anyone knows how to fix this please let me know. thanks for reading!","56":"I\u2019ve been on this app for two years and have no issues or bugs. I love reading the webtoons and am excited for more to come. \nRecently I\u2019ve noticed that the ones I\u2019m reading have lost all their bookmarks, I thought that was strange I\u2019ve never had that issue before. I had to go through all my comics and find where I left off. \nI love re-reading webtoons while patiently waiting for my favorite current webtoons to be updated by their amazing, hard working,  creators. I\u2019ve noticed that some of the ones I have finished have seem to restarted, like I never read it all. Then up to usually Chapter 5 there\u2019s this daily pass. It says you get two daily passes a day. So.. if I wanted to binge re-read a webtoon that is finished, there\u2019s basicly restrictions on it like a newly released one?? I find that strange.. \nAlso I read on my iPhone and iPad, and my bookmarks don\u2019t stay the same on my devices. So I could be on Chapter 12 on my phone, and 6 on my iPad. If I\u2019m using the same account shouldn\u2019t they always be saved no matter what device I use? \nWould be awesome if some of these things were explained, like the pass situation. And then the other two bugs fixed. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","57":"Webtoon is excellent most of the time- I\u2019ve gotten to read fantastic stories, drool at incredible art, and laugh at humor that makes your stomach hurt. It\u2019s really a great app that gives you a lot for free. \nOn that note. \nEver since the newest update, I\u2019ve found that Webtoon is EXTREMELY glitchy. And along with the update, Webtoon has been releasing a lot of events where you can log in, collect daily stamps, and receive an award of 5 coins, which can buy you one episode ahead of a webtoon\u2019s weekly update. It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for users like me that can\u2019t pay for Fast Pass episodes. But now, every time I see the pop up notice when I enter the app, it\u2019s completely white and doesn\u2019t allow me to tap on anything, and a few seconds later, it crashes and exits me out of the app. It\u2019s extremely bothersome and has prevented me from being able to participate in two events that I really looked forward to participating in. \nOverall, a wonderful app with many great stories for all ages, genres, and art styles. But the glitches in the system REALLY need to be fixed.","58":"I love this app and all of the wonderful and creative stories that are on here and the fact that this allows writers and readers alike a chance to experience these wonderful and compelling stories. However the new daily pass has been a huge hinderance to me, my first ever webtoon was Orange Marmalade and it\u2019s safe to say that I\u2019m glad it was, it was compelling and beautiful (highly suggest). Whenever I recently came back to read it all over again I was only allowed to read up to 2 episodes and had to come back a day later in order to read the next episode. Mind you this is a 119 episode comic so that would have taken me well over two months to complete as it stands. As I reader I had to consider if I was opening up webtoon for the very first time and was told that I had to wait for more content which was already made and out there I would have been absolutely furious, and probably not ever wanted to open up the app again, because I would have assumed that all webtoons were like this. Which they just are not, I hope you understand my concern which comes with this. I\u2019m an avid reader and absolutely love all of the personalities on the app, thank you for this consideration.","59":"I used to use webtoon a lot, and I loved it! There are some really good comics, and features like fast pass don\u2019t bother me much. However, after not using the app for a long time, I came back to reread (and finish for the first time) my favorite series, Hooky. I found that it was locked under daily pass, and after a certain point, I would get 1 free episode a day or have to pay for them. At over 200 episodes, this would take me the better part of a year. This didn\u2019t discourage me at first, because I love Hooky, and I wouldn\u2019t mind supporting the creator by buying the series. Then I did the math, and realized it would cost me over 60 dollars to buy the entire series. I would eagerly pay that money if I was being offered printed books, but they\u2019re asking me to pay for access to an online webcomic in low image quality that I can only access on one device. That\u2019s ridiculous. I think that part of this may be that price for episodes doesn\u2019t change based on length, and episodes for Hooky tend to be pretty short. I think that more thought should be put into how much they\u2019re charging for completed series, because I can\u2019t imagine many people would be willing to spend that kind of money.","60":"See I never really had a problem with this app until today. I just tried to use the app but every time I click it, it just exited out the app. The only way to fix it was to delete it and download it again, because turning my phone on and off didn\u2019t work. When I got back into my Webtoon account I go to see if I still have my coins that I purchased. I purchased 50 coins yesterday and after that I used it on a couple of stories, so I was left with 19. When I go to the series that I spent it on, it shows that I didn\u2019t purchase those fast pass chapters but I still list the coins. So it\u2019s like I paid for nothing. This makes me extremely angry because I have to buy more coins to get those chapters back and I try not to spend so much money on coins because I only use them for 2 stories on this app. I would appreciate if there was some way I didn\u2019t have to spend more money on those same episodes or if I can somehow get my coins back. Overall it is a great app and this was really the only time I\u2019ve had an issue with it, so I would live it if my problem was solved","61":"I love WEBTOON I used to use lezhin and WEBTOON at the same time but I always gave the edge to WEBTOON because it was so much easier to use and I was able to read whatever kind of WEBTOON I wanted anything I wanted. Now I am all for paying paying is important for the app and the people making the content that I love to read. But the coin system is terrible. I hate the coins and they were the reason I stopped using lezhin all together. Now if there was a monthly subscription that I could subscribe to, maybe have different types of subscription for different things. I will literally spend more money a month on WEBTOON than I would on netflix or something. But I refuse to buy coins. If there ever is a day that coins are gone or a day where they add a subscription on top of the coins than I will come back, but until the  I\u2019m either gonna not read any WEBTOON sin general or I\u2019m gonna try and read them for free online. But not because I want to I want to pay for my WEBTOON and support the people behind it, but they system you have now is so bad I refuse to use it. I know that I\u2019m one peeled on and that you don\u2019t care as a company that I\u2019m not using anymore but I really hope you see this and try and change your payment method I\u2019m the future I would love to come back and read my favorite WEBTOONs.","62":"I absolutely love WEBTOON and I don\u2019t think I could live with out it anymore. There is the downside of fast pass but there is upsides to that to but moving on. The format of WEBTOON is nice and easy to use and the colors are not to bright or too dim. If you are reading this to see if WEBTOON is a good app to use i reckons it 100% of the way if you can change my opinion I would give you $50 straight cash. The fact where it makes you wait for more episodes if the series is still continuing and your sitting there waiting for the next episode to come out just adds suspense to what\u2019s gonna happen next, though there is a way to getting around having to wait 4-7 days is buying coins. One thing WEBTOON should add is more events for coins because not everybody has a bunch of money and has the time to wait for the next episode. If you are a fast reader with no patience this might not be the app for you but either way you will love it. I do recommend  the fantasy and action series especially god of high school, unordinary, down to earth, and micro hunter.","63":"I\u2019ve had this app for a while now, and it\u2019s really good! ^^ I love how you don\u2019t gotta pay to read the comics, unless your buying one that hasn\u2019t come out yet. Now, when on this app there\u2019s SOO many different genres to pick from! Now, with it being so great, there has to be a little problem at least right? Well, the only two problems I really face, is when sometimes after getting to the end of a Comic, you keep scrolling to get to the next one, and there\u2019s usually an add and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but it sometimes just comes up. Like I don\u2019t need to touch it it just pops up, bringing me to a new browser, forcing me to get off it and go back to WEBTOON. Another like the last is when your scrolling to the next at the bottom, and it freezes. Just freezes. And you can\u2019t go to the next one, and you have to exit the app, and close the window and come back, find the same WEBTOON and go to the ep again. Now if these could be fixed that\u2019d be great, but even without them being fixed, WEBTOON is an amazing app, and I really recommend it! \u20223\u2022","64":"I don\u2019t usually write reviews but after watching webtoons for about 2 months I am in LOVE. Unlike other comic app that gives u 3 chapters to watch and then u have to pay for the rest of the chapters.. WEBTOON IS NOT LIKE THAT!! It\u2019s amazing because every comic has a lot chapters that are FREEE and then there\u2019s fast passes, the maximum is about five fast passes I believe. Fast passes are basically chapters that allow you to see  the next chapter your dying to see!! For coins, to get coins you have to pay real money, but sometimes they hold little competitions for coins, and all u have to do is read even more comics to get coins for the people who don\u2019t have money for that AND I LOVE IT!! In the beggining I was flat broke and wanted to read more and more chapters , then when I did get money I used about 30 dollars worth of REAL MONEY on this app! YES IM CRAZY!! But please don\u2019t let that frighten u! U don\u2019t have to get fast passes! In the mean time while your waiting there\u2019s some much good comics out there! Please I recommend this app!! GET IT NOW AND UR LIFE WILL CHANGE!!!","65":"Whenever I\u2019m read WEBTOON or scrolling it\u2019s freezes or kickes me out and I have full bars offline or I\u2019m in my home with WiFi it just freezes and it takes a minute for it to unfreeze when I get out of the app and if I do it to soon it\u2019s still on the page and it\u2019s still frozen another thing when it does unfreeze it\u2019s literally 2 seconds in the app then bam frozen and it\u2019s worse now I literally opened it and it froze can you please fix this issue but over all I do love the app I just have this issue that\u2019s messing up the whole experience and another issue that I really don\u2019t like is the new policy some creators have to go to other platforms to show their comics just because there 18+ can you change that because my friends and I hate that we have to pay the other platforms just to see one episode I get that you\u2019re trying to protect the kids to exposer but it\u2019s not the creators fault they put 18+ I remember that and that you had to agree the you\u2019re 18 or older but now I can\u2019t see the comics I used to read because they moved to other platforms and I hate paying for things because simply I don\u2019t have the money I\u2019m broke","66":"Ok I loved this app but now I\u2019m about to delete it I used to recommend this to all my friends and everything but no since the recent updated policy it\u2019s ridiculous! I love stories that go into detail and tackle hard subjects stories that hit you in your feelings and drag you in and make u wanna keep reading.. but how am I supposed to read a hard hitting story if all the hard topics get removed like I\u2019m sorry if a little 10-12 year old can\u2019t handle real life problems like why remove all stories like that why can\u2019t u just make an 18+ age restriction or just make it to where the authors have to put a warning label like rated m for mature like movies do... why do u have to take it away from everyone just bc a few don\u2019t like it... make it to we\u2019re if they want to read that certain series they have to agree to it and deal with if like if they don\u2019t like what the author posts then don\u2019t let them read it instead of ruining it for everyone.... like seriously this is ridiculous if something isn\u2019t changed to where my comics can go back to the way I like reading them I\u2019m just deleting the app and not dealing with all my favorite stories getting ruined and I\u2019ll make sure to tell everyone I know how awful this app has become.. u need to fix this it\u2019s awful","67":"I love the app I\u2019ve been on it for a couple years and it\u2019s amazing but... I understand that this will not be seen by many but I updated the app and then I attempted to reread a comic and I did so but after reading around 14 of them (btw the series was already finished) it stopped me and said unlock the next episode with a daily pass or coins which I think is absolutely stupid why would I need to wait another day so I can read another 14 chapters there trying to get more people to spend money on the app which I already have and I just want to enjoy the comic and read not wait until tomorrow to read it or pay money I understand the fast pass that you get with buying coins but to make someone pay to read something that\u2019s already finished is just stupid they are becoming like any other stingy comic app I do not support this new update and think they should get rid of it I love the app but it just disappoints me that there becoming so stingy. And I don\u2019t know who decided on this update but they should get demoted from there position it\u2019s just a really bad call by the app I\u2019ll still use the app but it\u2019s still a very bad decision by the company","68":"Webtoon is SUCH and amazing app, and I love to read the stories everyday, but as of late they\u2019ve added a new Coin system which sadly makes it like all of the other reading apps now. What made Webtoon so unique was the fact that you could read the stories whenever you wanted WHEREVER you wanted, and for FREE. I get that your trying to pay the creators but you could find some other way of doing that with out having to add extremely EXCESSIVE timers for new episodes. Why do you make the wait so long? What\u2019s the purpose of making a reader wait 2 weeks if they don\u2019t want to\/can\u2019t pay for 5 coins? That\u2019s not fair to the readers, and it won\u2019t be fair to the creators when they start loosing views because of this money-grabbing update. It would be more reasonable if you shortened the timers to a full day MAX. The trade off for 2 weeks per chapter just isn\u2019t worth it, and it honestly makes me less inclined to use this app anymore. Webtoon if you see this comment please know that their are others that are just as unhappy and unsatisfied with this update and we really hope you can do something to change it.","69":"so i\u2019ve has webtoon for about 4 years now and there are some stories that i\u2019ve read that are already completed. and a few months ago i went to go reread a story called \u201corange marmalade\u201d. i had already read that story about 3-4 times. and it had a daily pass. i was pretty upset but thought nothing of it until today i went to reread another story that i had read and it said that it was going to become a daily pass series. so as i went and looked, ALL of the completed stores were going to be daily pass. PLEASE webtoon do NOT have a daily pass thing on these stories. i have already read them and i just wanted to reread them. i would take me FOREVER to read them again. i liked the completed section because the whole point of having it was so that we could read a story all in one go. but with this new daily pass thing we won\u2019t be able to do that. i wouldn\u2019t mind having to watch an ad every few episodes to read a story but having to wait an ENTIRE day to read a story that has already been completed seems a bit unfair to me. please webtoon get rid of the daily pass thing!","70":"Webtoon is such a good app for comics, especially when apps like lezhin make you pay to read. I was fine with the fast pass system bc it supports the artist\/ author while also not forcing readers to pay; it just offered readers a choice to buy coins to read ahead. But then they added fast pass to COMPLETED SERIES. I think this is unnecessary and will hurt the authors most in the end. Who wants to wait for a completed series??? Also, after an ongoing series is finished, will webtoon automatically make it fast pass again??? This fast pass system works for ongoing webtoons; but on completed ones, it just discourages new readers even more so to read completed series. With this step, I fear that Webtoons will slowly turn more and more monetized and like lezhin comics. I really hate to see such a great app and platform for artists and authors to display their work but also gain support and money for their work while readers don\u2019t have to sacrifice anything turn to a system where it is now requiring readers to wait or pay to read something that is already finished or turn to a system where readers have to pay to read:((","71":"First of all, I have loved Webtoon. It\u2019s a great app and a great place to find comics of all types... until recently. The new policy banning any nsfw content is hurting artists and readers a lot. A couple of my favorite artists have quit webtoon because of this policy, and I\u2019ve seen many others posting updates saying \u201cIn case we get taken down\u201d etc. This policy is limiting creative freedom and story telling from the artists. While a lot of stories can be told without any nsfw content, some cannot, or some are greatly diminished for lack of this content. The policy is hurting readers who have to see some of their favorite stories come to an end, some without anywhere else to find them, I\u2019m sure. The policy will hurt Webtoon as well, since they will lose many users due to the content limitations brought about by this policy. There is no reason to ban all nsfw content when there were many safeguards in place before to prevent sensitive eyes from viewing this content. I have never once opened up an nsfw comic and been surprised to see what was inside. There are warnings in place, and age confirmation, and even then the content is censored so nothing super graphic is shown. Get rid of this ridiculous new policy. Give us back our freedom of choice and creativity.","72":"I am lost for words right now with how upset I am. The disappointment that I am experiencing is astronomical. There is so, so much content on this website and I have slowly been chipping away at my favorite stories for LITERALLY YEARS. IM ACTUALLY IN TEARS RIGHT NOW! Now not only do I have to wait weeks and weeks to read a portion of a new story but I also have to wait MONTHS to read an old one that has hundreds of chapters! How greedy can you possibly be? I have never left a comment on an app but I love the webtoon community too much not to complain because this actually hurts my heart. I don\u2019t even have to tell you what I\u2019m talking about because you know! Every person alive is complaining about it BECAUSE ITS BAD! I hope the entire team of this app is able to look at the numbers and understand that this is the kind of greed that sends apps down-hill and into the ground. I will never get to reread my favorite stories again because guess what! Im a poor college kid! Thanks guys for all of the memories and for being one of the only things that made me happy and kept me afloat. I\u2019ll see you all again if\/when daily passes go away...","73":"The new updates include a coin system which you have to pay to read story\u2019s. There\u2019s also the fact that you can\u2019t screenshot anymore. Thankfully I haven\u2019t been affected as my settings for this app wasn\u2019t on auto update (thank god). I think that it was because the former CEO was involuntarily fired from his position this month or last month. Please don\u2019t turn into one of those typical web comic apps were you have to pay for everything. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading webtoons for over 2 years and this is the only app that\u2019s actually free. Please don\u2019t change that. A lot of people only come to Webtoon because of the fact that it\u2019s free and if you take that away then many will start to favor other apps. I\u2019m practically begging you, the next update, please remove the coin system and add our right to screenshot back. A lot of people use characters from Webtoon for their wall paper because of the beautiful art but they won\u2019t be able to do that not. Hopefully this he\u2019s noticed, slim chance, but there\u2019s still a small hope. Anyways, I hope you can  agree that these things aren\u2019t exactly was Webtoon needs right now.","74":"This is probably the best digital comic site I have ever been on. It\u2019s so easy to read other creators stories and also make your own comics and put it on the app\/website. I am so in love with Webtoon and I am so happy I had found it because now I have something to do when I have absolutely nothing to do during the weekends\/summer. I follow them on social media (Instagram) as well and the people who work there are the absolute sweetest. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to their booths and buy merch from my favorite comics. I have been searching for places to start posting comics on and though, there may be many, Webtoon was the best choice for me. this app is,no joke, amazing and the comics on there are so cute and can actually grab your attention!!! I love seeing the different art styles and love seeing the character development! But I think they could do some work on the \u201cDiscover\u201d area so that more artists can be found! but other than that, I hope this app will soon grow even more popularity than it has right now.","75":"idk how yall work but itd be rly nice to bring some of those korean webtoons into here\ud83d\ude29 like ive rly been wanting to read \uc5ec\uc2e0\uac15\ub9bc in english ( descent of a goddess \/ the secret of angel by ya ong lee ) like is there any way you could or does someone have to do it for everyone ? some other webtoons (besides english) have it, so it\u2019s a bummer. OH OH OH AND BY THE WAY i LOVE \u201cthe sound of your heart\u201d by choseok but the order in it is extremely messy and definitely different from the original korean one. like one episode he\u2019s unmarried and young and the next i find out he and aebong are married and have a baby. i\u2019m not angry or anything but i would really like to see all the stuff that was skipped in that huge leap.\nedit: HEYYY IM BAck and haha tysm bc you listened to my first request so ig here\u2019s like my third and final wish genie. i\u2019ve been wanting to read the english ver. of \u201c\uc5f0\uc560\ud601\uba85\u201d on naver webtoon (KR ver.) also known as \u201clove revolution\u201d. it looks rly cute and ill delete lezhin comics or whatever if you listen to me like you have my word. <3 please notice me hahahaha","76":"Ahem.. I found this from a Lookism ad. From then on... I FELL IN LOVE WITH SO MANY CARTOONS!!! Like Lookism,unOrdinary,Lumine! I SUGGEST YOU DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! I mean yeah there are little banners for ads but you don\u2019t have to buy anything and the ads you can just swipe away. SO. This is the best app I have ever used! And I suggest you read Lookism,unOrdinary,and Lumine. But also you can read the others to. But anyways... THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER!!!!! So I suggest you download it if you haven\u2019t already! Because the rush of excitement when a comic updates or if there is an epic fight scene! Then that is amazing.. I mean yeah you loose that excitement after a bit but when a new thing that\u2019s exciting comes out then it\u2019s amazing!!! But anyways yeah there might be a few low points when one ends but it\u2019s fine! There will always be another one to read! So basically if ya still are thinking about it.. DOWNLOAD IT!!! It\u2019s really good!! And if you think otherwise don\u2019t give it a horrible review because that\u2019s just what you think and others have other opinions! SOOOO... Give it a try!\n\n:>","77":"I\u2019ve been reading my comics on Webtoons a for about 3 years now and I always enjoy it. I love the app because it\u2019s free and it offers a good variety, while also allowing artists to test out what they want their comics to look like. But from what I\u2019ve been seeing lately with this new policy, it is greatly affecting the discover Webtoons, since there is now a new restriction on NSFW content. I understand why they want the comics to be able to appeal to all ages, but at the end of the day not every comic is meant for everyone to read, and even when you regulate mature content so that people confirm their age, the comics are still able to be read. While this is a problem, it should not be a reason to completely get rid of comics, that is basically telling an artist that they are not free to create their comic the way that they want. When this happens, a lot of artist will start to go to sites that are not free or that are of poor quality and it\u2019s not fair to them and the fans of these comics. I sincerely hope that Webtoons returns their policy to the way it was or at least revise it a bit because this new one is way too much.","78":"The app is very fun and I enjoy it a lot however there\u2019s a few things that bother me. First of all their new policy. Now you have to watch adds before you can read the update and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re reading ahead you just have to watch an add to read the update. Which wouldn\u2019t bother me but you need a stable internet connection to watch the video. So i think it\u2019s a bit dumb because if you don\u2019t have good connection a notice saying \u201ctry watching again later\u201d will pop up, so you can\u2019t even read the update. the policy is really just \u201cwatch an add to read these updates\u201d not \u201cwatch an add and read ahead\u201d  So it\u2019s kinda false advertising. The second problem is that webtoon should not be 12+ there\u2019s material on there that a 12 year old shouldn\u2019t be reading. i would say at least 14+ or higher. there\u2019s a lot of content that\u2019s not age appropriate so i don\u2019t think 12 year olds should end up seeing that themselves. and yes there is a notice that will pop up and say \u201cthis is 18 and up\u201d but how\u2019s that gonna stop a little kid from just tapping \u201ci\u2019m 18+\u201d and reading whatever is on there.","79":"I am totally in love and addicted to this app but I am really frustrated at the fact there are daily passes. I like to binge read the stories and daily passes prevent me from doing so. I understand the app needs to make money but I'm very disappointed. Most stories have about 100+ chapters and that would take more than 3 months to finish reading the story. Readers will be on the app less and less because of the wait. I suggest putting 30 second ads before chapters so readers don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money on coins. I wouldn\u2019t mind paying a few dollars for the whole app. I feel these methods will make everyone happy and benefit Webtoon in a positive way, ratings will get much better and the app will make so much more money. Authors\/artists\/creators work SOO HARD drawing and writing these stories and I feel like they should get more recognition. IMAGINE DRAWING 100+ CHAPTERS?!?!? Another issue with daily passes are if you do pay to read the chapters instead of a daily pass you only get them for 14 DAYS?!?! WHAT DJSKKFWKDJD HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE PLEASE EXPLAIN WEBTOON!!!! It\u2019s the daily passes for me. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this app to anyone who likes to read a lot because you have to wait so long to read a whole story. \n\nmeeting is adjourned.","80":"First off I wanna say I really like this app until we have to pay for the coins . I know I\u2019m the only who\u2019s upset about the coins or the daily pass, many people like it that way others not so much, I feel like you guys should  add ad\u2019s so we can get coin like 5 coins per ad\u2019s not bad huh ? . But instead we have to wait 21 days just for one episode!! Then wait more days just for another episode. I\u2019m only saying this because many of us can\u2019t buy coins to read the next episode so we have to wait for years and years just to read one . I\u2019m not trying to sound rude or anything but reading off the comments I think many of these people are right about the daily passes and the coins too . Because I can\u2019t buy coins to get the free passes . So I have to wait almost a month just to read my favorite stories. I feel like you guys should  add ad\u2019s so many of us don\u2019t have to wait. But it\u2019s up to you guys I\u2019m not forcing anyone to do anything. Just wanted to share my opinion with you guys . And hope you guys read this","81":"I absolutely love webtoon. I've been on the app since the end of 2018, and I've read a bunch of different stories and a bunch of different genres. The is SO MUCH out there that have super good plots and characters and art, but webtoon only seems to promote the same 5. (You know which ones) I'm not hating on the promoted series at all, because I understand that this is how webtoon makes their money is by having these popular series. However there are so many underrated webtoons, on originals and discover. Another thing I dislike is daily pass. If I was subscribed to the series before it went on daily pas shouldn't I be able to read it for free?? I understand that the creators need to make money and all but if I read it before it ended I shouldn't have to pay to read those same episodes again. To summarize Webtoon needs to promote different generes,( they've been getting better, but still not as diverse as I'd like) and to change the daily pass, (not get rid of it altogether, but to tweak it so it's not totally unfair.","82":"Yes, I love webtoon. Webtoon has a wide variety of comics to read and is very amazing. Each episode may take a week to create, but that is completely normal for an author. For me, I loved webtoon because of how I could access comics for free. Now, I feel as if webtoon is trying to slowly transition from free to paying money for episodes. Ik that someday webtoon will be a full purchase app and I will honestly be very disappointed when that day comes. A few authors changed their updating schedule just so that they could earn more money. This disappoints and I hope that webtoon doesn\u2019t fully become a app where u have to pay. If that happens I\u2019ll just go back to watching anime for free\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Not only this, but there isn\u2019t enough features webtoons. I have read most of the featured webtoons and am reading a lot of discover webtoons, but it is very hard to keep up with discover webtoons when they have inconsistent updating schedules, rookie episodes, and lots of hiatuses. This is just some things I wish webtoon would change. By saying stuff about discover, I mean they should feature more discover webtoons.","83":"I read WEBTOONs every day and I love it so much, but ever since this new policy has come out with the ban of mature content, lots of creators have had to censor their content or even just cut entire chunks out of the story just to meet WEBTOON\u2019s guidelines which isn\u2019t fair to the creators or the fans because it means that we\u2019re not getting the full story that the author wants us to get. Like I know of a few comics for which I read late and after the guidelines happened and chunks to half of the story was just cut out of it and so I get very confused with the story going on words since i don\u2019t know what happened. I just hope that after webtoon reads all of the fans complaints and what they think of the new policy that they will find some other way to distribute mature content so that everyone else can go back to reading their favorite comics the way the creators wanted us to and that soon webtoon will go back to the way it used to be. I sincerely love this app altogether, but this new policy is making it harder for me to enjoy and love my favorite creators comics they way they instead us to.","84":"I hot WEBTOON after lots of persuasion from my friends and a few interesting ads on Instagram, but have noticed a major issue. If you have an account on one device with all your series and current episodes saved in it, then switch over to another device logged in the same way, your progress doesn\u2019t save. This is a bit annoying for me because my battery stinks so I\u2019ll usually read one series until one device dies then switch over to my other one and continue where I think I left off. However, in the process of trying to find what episode I\u2019m on I sometimes accidentally spoil what\u2019s going to happen. In a much more common sense, if a person read WEBTOON on their tablet and phone but had to travel and could only bring their phone, their progress would not be saved and they would have to search for it. If multiple device sharing could be included in the next update that would be great, but even if not this app is a great way for creators and fans to enjoy art together.","85":"I love this app so much and started reading from it daily \ud83d\ude01 although it has its perks, The one thing I\u2019m not a big fan of is how you have to buy coins\ud83d\ude2d The prices are fair but I feel like everyone should get like five coins a week! Or maybe a little longer for the wait but either way what I\u2019m trying to say is I love everything except how you HAVE to buy coins. That\u2019s just my personal opinion as someone who doesn\u2019t have a job, but I also kind of like the system surrounding that too, it\u2019s fairly cheap prices so I don\u2019t have too much to say about it. Either way\u2026 an amazing app all around! I love it so much and will be a loyal reader for as long as comics exist\ud83d\udc95 Great varieties of genres and comics to read! Absolutely wonderful stories and great designs. Easy to use with a simple layout. Also some extremely talented artists as well. There\u2019s something for everyone here and that\u2019s what I love about it\ud83d\ude0aMy favorite so far is \u201cfreaking romance\u201d by snailords \ud83e\udd70 100% recommend this app for every comic fan\u2764\ufe0f","86":"Before I start, I want to clarify that I am ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED with the Webtoon platform. I\u2019ve been using it for over a year now and I quickly fell in love with the wide range of options, the wonderful art and creators, and the way that the app makes things so simple and leisurely when it comes to accessing comics or supporting creators. I respect the industry a lot, and I love supporting the creators by spending money for fast passes- they are always worth it!\nRecently, in fact, there was a new feature added where you can watch ads to acquire access to some popular Canvas webtoons.\nNow, I love the idea of this feature. Not only do I get to read my favorite Canvas webtoons early like any other Original Webtoon, but I can support the authors- who have always produced comics entirely for free- now.\nBut, sadly, it\u2019s not very simple.\nIt would appear that there aren\u2019t very many ads to display so far on the platform- this causes the ad playing service to work very poorly. After a while the ad playing cancels it out, making it so you can\u2019t play an ad to earn an episode no matter how many times you try. It\u2019s not new, either. Many people have gone through the same. \nI love the new update and I love the idea, but it could definitely use some tweaking. I would really appreciate if this could be worked on, as I would really love to continue to support my favorite creators as much as I can. Thanks!","87":"All the bad reviews are about the old policy which allows 18+ Webtoon to be uploaded. Now listen, you as someone deciding to download this app, should not pay a single half a brain cell to those comments. Probably an unpopular opinion, I really don\u2019t care about this \u201cnew\u201d update - I said OPINION. I don\u2019t go on Webtoon to read 18+ material. If you do or thinking of so, please consider a different app like the reviews beg you to do so. There are a TON of good Webtoons on Webtoon and I bet you can find something good to read off the app. So again, pay no mind to the many stupid comments about  not getting the app, because it\u2019s worth it. I could sit here all day and give you some good titles but here is 5. Now I have to figure out which ones to choose \ud83d\ude02. Off of Webtoon: True Beauty, ( Kpop Army Fans ) Save Me, Freaking Romance. Off of Discover, Unloveable Replacement, and Fragmented. Extra: Lookism cause it has a good message- warning tho it\u2019s kinda dark. Enjoy and find a good one to read!","88":"when I first got WEBTOON, I immediately fell in love because I could read comics for FREE. I am fine with the rules on NSFW stories, although it bothers me that authors who\u2019ve created those types of comics were forced to take down their hard work. I was thinking that WEBTOON could create a section for those 17+ to verify their age, and so that readers could enjoy that genre, plus the fact that authors can publish their hard work\/creativity with out worrying about it being taken down. the rule that concerns me the most is that WEBTOON recently added a coin feature where readers would have to pay in order to read comics such as True Beauty or SAVE ME. to improve this, WEBTOON could add the option to watch a couple of ads or to pay with coins, right now they only have the coin option, which elucidates the fact that some individuals can\u2019t afford to pay for coins, so I think that readers and authors could be happy with these new improvements suggested. overall, I enjoy reading the comics, it\u2019s just those two rules that concern me.","89":"So I absolutely LOVE WEBTOON!!!!! I logged on and I was subscribed to a lot a lot of WEBTOONs and for some apparent reason it logged me out. So I was just like it\u2019s ok I\u2019ll log back in and I tried tons of times and it still wouldn\u2019t let me. Then I tried logging in with my google account. It wouldn\u2019t let me after dozens of times and then the next day I tried logging back in and it wouldn\u2019t let me!!!!! I was so sad and mad!!!! Then I tried making a new account countless times but it wouldn\u2019t let me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21then I tried logging in with google again. guess what it didn\u2019t work. So the it came to Facebook I tried and it didn\u2019t work!!!!!! I try AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT STILL NOTHING!!!!! I\u2019m very madddddd!!!!!!!!! BUT! I recommend this app (even if it won\u2019t let me log in) it\u2019s amazing and I cried because of tons of WEBTOONs and they are all amazing!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\ude01 I recommend reading romance at first I did not like romance at all but then it became one of my favorites to read!! I get all the feelings and I cry and laugh and my heart starts pounding and OMG ITS JUST WOW!!!!\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06","90":"So basically this already has happened 2 times now and I get very frustrated when this happened sometimes when I open webtoon I am on my account and all but then one day it logged me out. I was very confused so I tried logging back in but it said it was wrong and that the password wasn\u2019t right so I tried logging in with a saved webtoon account password and another email but it still didn\u2019t work. I made a new account and it lasted for sometime but I had to subscribe to every webtoon I read,rated,and liked but it happened again today and tried doing the same like last time and it  still didn\u2019t work! So I tried making a new account again but it didn\u2019t let me use the email I used for the other accounts. Please I love webtoon and I want to support everyone on the app,the creators,and their AMAZING storytelling please try to fix this!\n\nPlease try to fix this issue I don\u2019t want to panic again about my account being automatically logged out.","91":"Now I love WEBTOON. It\u2019s one of the sites I use a lot, and all the content on there is absolutely phenomenal. Like Refund High School! I love that WEBTOON, one of my favorites. But since the series ended, I would re-read it over and over. But now I can\u2019t. Now literally everyone can\u2019t, because after the first six episodes that are released for free, you have to wait to re-read it. I\u2019ve literally waited for it when it first released, and now I have to wait some more?! It\u2019s not just Refund High School, it\u2019s over half of them. It discourages new people from reading the old WEBTOONs because of the fact they have to wait for it. I honestly don\u2019t see why they were even added, unless it was a way to get more money from coin sales. Other than that I think it\u2019s a scummy move. I wish you would get rid of it, or at least change it a bit, or something. Thanks for reading my review.\n\n-Sincerely, an avid WEBTOON reader and fan","92":"I absolutely love this app, the daily pass stuff isn\u2019t the best but I have no problem with it. But recently I\u2019ve noticed that this app glitches a lot. I would go on the app and press one toon I want to read, and it freezes up for a second before taking me back to my home page and I have to press the app again to go back onto it. It also tends to do this thing where the comic I press won\u2019t open because \u201cTitle Not Found\u201d pops up, but when I leave that one and go to another, it opens perfectly fine. I used to think that it was just my phone and not the app. But over time I\u2019ve noticed that none of my other apps ever did this. Also, when I delete recently read comics, the comic either freezes there for a longer time than normal, or deleted and comes back. I\u2019m sure by now that these issues are not because of my phone, or internet because I\u2019ve dealt with these issues for a long enough time to tell that it is probably app itself. Please get back to me on this.","93":"Would totally recommend, so many comics to read! Though I wish a few things were different. I wish that there was the feature to say \u201cI\u2019ve already seen this\u201d or \u201cI dislike this artist and\/or I dislike this style, episode, yeah yeah yeah all that jazz. It would be an amazing feature! Since I have multiple accounts, when I look at the recommendations bit of the home page, usually all of them I\u2019ve already seen, so I wish I could get new recommendations. They really upped their game with the second to last update though. I would also really like to see the feature of double tap to like. It would be so much easier, and I find myself tapping when I don\u2019t realize I have to go to the bottom left and click the button. Enough with the complaining, all and all this is an amazing app, and the fact that its free makes me really wow and the quality of this app development. Crazy epic job. Thank you so much for releasing this!! <3","94":"This app lets you read amazing comics from a variety of genres including fantasy, romance, thriller, etc. The comics update once a week and you can check when some of your Webtoons update in your little library. (Sometimes more than once a week, but honestly, who\u2019s complaining??) \n    There are so many skillful artists and each art style is so different that you can pick what you like. You can even BE an artist! Yes, you also can create a series with your drawings. (If you have the guts to do it) \n     In addition, if you hate to wait for next week and want to cut to the chase, some artists create art in advance and you will have to buy coins to unlock it. (Sadly, I broke and have no money\ud83d\ude2d)\n     All in all, this is one of the greatest apps I have ever downloaded and I don\u2019t regret downloading this extraordinary app. I am so obsessed with it I even memorized which WEBTOON comes on which day. I totally recommend this app to anyone who wants to try it.","95":"Okay, I am honestly fine with the weekly updates which a lot of the critical reviews hate. The concept is good and after getting to know some of the creators, I can see how they love doing what they do. I respect them so much and I appreciate the effort they put in to provide such good comics. I also love the Greenlight idea and it helps a lot. My only problem with this app is the reply bots. I will make a comment in a webtoon and I will get a comment notification. When I check it, the link leads me to some pornographic website or a dating site. Keep in mind my dad has disabled my ability to delete search history so he sees everything I have been to on Safari. As a 13 year old, this really annoys me and I am sick of seeing links being commented in my e-mails. It is at the point where I will get e-mails biweekly from comments and I ignore them. Sometimes when I critique a character, I cannot have positive conversations with other readers because I ignore comments. Please get this fixed.","96":"I really like this app and I always am excited for the updates on the comics I read! I like the part where you can watch ads to read an extra chapter, it helps support the smaller authors! But, I don\u2019t like the daily passes. I know that some older finished comics haven\u2019t made as much money as the could\u2019ve because they were made before the coins were released. I like to revisit comics. Maybe shorten up the wait time or do 2 comics every 2 days, but overall, great app!! Also I have a few ideas! You could have \u201cpackage deals\u201d for WEBTOON\u2019s fast pass on a specific comic for example, normally all 5 fast passes for WEBTOON\u2019s would be 25 coins (I think?) but you could have a \u201cpackage deal\u201d and make it 20 coins for 5 episodes and a lot of people would buy it since it is cheaper. Of course this is a flawed idea but you could test the idea out possibly. Or it could be for daily passes for older comics and you could buy the whole comic and all the episodes for cheaper!","97":"I\u2019ve had webtoon for a very long time and I\u2019ve always loved and I took a small break from reading them and I was trying to back to some old ones that had finished and I saw that there is a feature called daily pass... the more I look into it the more I hate it. It lets you read ONE ep a day. This is why I take breaks from webtoon so I can let the series I follow release a couple of eps. I don\u2019t like to be limited to one a day I like to read AT LEAST 3 or 4 a day If I\u2019m interested. I don\u2019t mind the coin system like for the fast pass I\u2019m glad there is an option for that so the creator can make more money but it also doesn\u2019t effect the people that don\u2019t want to pay for it. But of course you can pay coins for more pass for the completed series which is not worth it in my opinion. You already see an ad every time you finish an ep.... anyway to wrap this up I hope webtoon gets rid of this system even though they probably won\u2019t because they have been slowly adding paywalls. If they continue to put these silly pay ways up I will be moving away from the app.","98":"I have found that on certain comics people will spam links in the comment replies to very adult websites. People often have to be warned not to type the link in in these comment sections. And though there is a report button, it doesn't seem to do anything. I've reported several very innapropriate comments and have never seen a difference.\nI have frequently reported extremely mean spirited comments and things that have been sexual in nature and have never seen a difference. I've seen homophobic, transphobic, biphobic, and racist comments and no one has ever done anything about them. Why is there a report comment button if nothing happens? There are younger people on this app who don't need to be seeing those kinds of comments and thinking that that kind of behavior is okay. This is really the only issue I have, I enjoy all of the comics I read and it's very easy to get sucked into storylines. Just maybe try steering clear of the comment section sometimes.","99":"It wasn\u2019t letting me set up an account with my new email. I was trying to set up a new account with my new email and it said that my account was already existing so I tried to log in with the email and it said that my account with my email didn\u2019t exist. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because I\u2019ve never made account with the email I\u2019m trying to use, and it also doesn\u2019t make sense because it\u2019s telling me my account exists and that it doesn\u2019t exist at the same time. I tried deleting the app and when I re-downloaded it I tried to set up an account again and it finally worked. It said that it was going to send me an email so I could confirm my account and use the app but it\u2019s been 10 minutes and I still haven\u2019t got the email. So now I don\u2019t know what to do because my account actually exists this time but i cant use the app because it won\u2019t send me the email to confirm my account...so I then tried to log in with my old account with my old email and it said my account wasn\u2019t existing, again. I was really looking forward to using this app since I haven\u2019t used it in a while but this is all so frustrating and confusing.","100":"To start off with, I absolutely love WEBTOON!!! There\u2019s nothing I love more than to sit and enjoy new comics. The only issue I\u2019m having is the notch on my iPhone 11 Pro Max covering some of the content. I know this is a very minor flaw but extremely inconvenient and aggravating at times. When I\u2019m reading a long scene with dialogue at the start of an episode, I have to hold down on the comic to read the beginning of every episode. It\u2019s simply frustrating sometimes. Same issue with reading in landscape mode (which in my opinion is a much better experience). The notch on whichever side of the screen will cover content and or dialogue. Secondly is the daily pass. I understand that it\u2019s a way of keeping content from being sped through and actually think it\u2019s a good idea. But I think it should be upped to three episodes a day. Hopefully this review is seen and taken into account. Thank you content creators and developers of WEBTOON!!! Your hard work doesn\u2019t go unappreciated!","101":"First is there any way I can be able to listen to music while on the app irk if this is the app that can be fixed or something I can do but I really wanna listen to music \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 But to the main point before I lose ya: This is honestly what everyone says so I\u2019m just gonna make this quick. I really dislike the new policy. As an example as a user there\u2019s this really great author I love and her story is amazing! But nothing bad has happened in her story yet and she says that she might not be able to write on WEBTOON anymore. Her content is (well hasn\u2019t yet but she said it will be) nsfw but there should be like a child block or something a parent can put on the app so their child\/ children don\u2019t read that stuff if u get what I mean. Yes this is kinda an app for kids but seriously there are \u201cage appropriate stories\u201d showing some things I bet parents wouldn\u2019t like. If that is fixed I think you\u2019d get a lot of new supporters and maybe 5 stars...but still love the app lol just a thing that bothers me!","102":"I use this app almost everyday, the stories on here are fairly interesting!! Not going to lie i did download this app a couple months ago, and didn\u2019t really use it so i did deleted it, until i saw an add pop up on my game about this comic. So i decided i was going to get this not realizing that this was the app i deleted. (I saw True Beauty) as an ad. I then decided to start browsing to my likings, and i was very satisfied on how there was so much to choose from!! I\u2019m more of a romance|drama type of girl, which i found tons of story\u2019s like that. My only problem with this app is that... wait there is none! some people might think i\u2019m over exaggerating, but i actually really enjoy the creators of the comics, and the app. I\u2019m so glad i gave this app a second chance! Some comics i like reading are...  Socializing101, True Beauty, Down to Earth, Lore Olympus, and Freaking Romance. Sorry if this was a lot, but i really do enjoy this app!! Keep the updates coming!","103":"First and foremost I wanna say I think the app was very enjoyable for me to use because it was a free platform for writers to spread their ideas and stories, and I loved using it. However, this new policy that has been implemented has almost ruined my experience on the app in its entirety. By adding all of these restrictions to what content authors can post has hindered or discontinued many of the webtoons I\u2019m subbed to, especially the webtoons that contain censored nsfw content. I find the new policy very unreasonable and unfair to the authors who slaved over their work, only for it to be taken down. These restrictions also makes many readers\u2019 experience on the app suffer, my own included. Over half of my subbed webtoons contained nsfw content, so I am extremely upset and disheartened. You all need to implement a way to restrict access to underage people from viewing the webtoons with mature content, because it\u2019s unfair to ruin everyone\u2019s experience due to a small number of people\u2019s discomfort. I\u2019m honestly so disappointed with the way the situation was handled and I hope to see a revision soon because at this point I\u2019m very close to uninstalling the app all together.","104":"Webtoons started off great. The main hurdle to get over was that to read ahead on a series I loved, I had to use the app. I got over it; the app UI is pretty intuitive. The new daily pass system for completed series is BS as a one chapter per day limit makes it difficult to reread old favorites. They passed the cost of storing and hosting comics they can no longer monetize by incentivizing reading ahead ahead onto the consumer. Unlocking  a completed series chapter using a daily pass keeps the chapter visible for only 14 days, limiting you ability to go back and stimulate your memory on concurrent story lines. Additionally, the UI to find my Daily Pass-requiring reads is poor. Unlike Subscribed series, which have their own tab and send notifications as they update, there is no reminder when you have a new daily pass for a completed series. You also have to find these series in the recent tab, along with everything else you have looked at. A separate section for series with chapters you unlocked using a daily pass would improve the experience a lot.","105":"I love comics so I went through so many comic apps and this became my favorite one! A free app with free comics. I kept finding ones that took forever to unlock and were expensive to buy. You guys had fast pass but that was reasonable and I was fine with it but suddenly you started daily pass. That\u2019s too far. You\u2019re going to turn into a \u201cfree\u201d app and have to pay for everything in it within a year. People love these comics. I love these comics. You\u2019re going to annoy readers to where they get rid of it because while you think it\u2019ll make you more money it really won\u2019t because not just anyone can afford to drop 100 some dollars to read. It\u2019s not nice. You\u2019re ruining the experience. I don\u2019t want to have to pay to reread my favorite comics. You have loyal readers that can quickly drop the app with how upset you\u2019re going to make them. Don\u2019t turn into literally every other comic app. Not all fans will stay if it turns into that. Please consider getting rid of the feature. It\u2019s not going to work out well and you\u2019re going to upset so many people. Please please please..","106":"This is honestly the best apps for reading comics\/webtoons I\u2019ve ever used. I love the layout, the stories featured are wonderful, and the fact that series can insert background music ??!!! THIS APP IS AMAZING. It makes me want to avoid reading on my browser and some of the stories like Lore Olympus and True Beauty leave me rereading the whole thing until it updates again. ITS ALL FREE AND YOU CAN CHOOSE TO SPEND MONEY TO SUPPORT THE APP TO READ AHEAD AS WELL! My only issue is some of the bugs that arise like selecting the story from my saved tab and being given an error message, or when it freezes completely and knocks out the application, but I believe they fixed it in the recent updates. Haven\u2019t had that issue for a while so all is well for me now :)) hope everyone that picks up this app enjoys it as much as I do! I rarely rate anything but I realize if I\u2019m going to spend this much time on one app it\u2019s gonna be this one that gets a written statement from me!","107":"I really like this app! I love reading the stories everyday and I like how the authors take the time to upload their amazing stories. I never really write reviews but I think this is something that should be updated\/added. I have WEBTOON on my iPad and I recently got a phone, I wanted to get the app on my phone to keep reading but the books I\u2019ve read never showed up. I searched online and it said that the books you\u2019ve read only stay on that certain device. I think the books read and the specific episodes read should be with everyone\u2019s account just like the coins, comments, and subscriptions. I have a lot of WEBTOONs that I would really like to read but if I don\u2019t have my iPad I would really miss out on that and have to restart everything. It would be great if WEBTOON could add the books read linked with the same account no matter the device it would be really helpful! Overall great app and love the stories!","108":"The app is great and the comics are amazing but I honestly hate this stupid daily pass. Like I understand it\u2019s supposed to help pay the creators and that makes sense but the only reason I stayed with WEBTOON for so long was because there were always completed comics available while I waited for the unfinished ones to update. There were so many amazing stories that I binged for weeks but now it feels like they\u2019re slowly being put behind a paywall. I love this app to death and I don\u2019t plan on dropping it anytime soon but can you guys please do something about this?\nLike make all the daily pass episodes completely available every once in a while or take down a comic from daily pass after a while. I know from experience that there is a bunch of pirated WEBTOONs and comics that people can find for free with a few clicks but I really don\u2019t want to do that. It feels wrong and immoral so please do something about it? Thanks","109":"Hey I just want to say that this app is amazing even though there are things that can be annoying. I think that the set up is great and the stories are amazing but the only problem is daily pass. Like come on, when someone finishes to write there story and you want to read it it\u2019s just like\u201duse daily pass \u201cand then you have to use coins. Like the only reason I downloaded this app is bc I thought it was different I thought that it would be free but nope. So this app is amazing but please can you do smth about daily pass. Lastly, I agree with every critical review like daily pass has got to go it\u2019s just going to make less people look at the stories. So the only reason I give this rate is bc the stories are amazing and that the writer are amazing at art. So yeah that\u2019s all. So pars do smth about daily pass. Bye\n\nPs: I know this is a very dumb question but what is the reason or daily pass like most of the stories are like +100 episodes like seriously.... so yeah please DO SOMETHING","110":"WEBTOON used to be my favorite app, I used to read comics on it every day. There\u2019s bunches of very talented artists and authors on here and it\u2019s very easy to use, however, My favorite WEBTOONs have all been completed for years -and I like to reread them a lot. With the new update of daily passes ruins all the positives of this app. If I would have reviewed this app before daily passes became apart of it, I would have rated it 5 stars and wrote a glowing review. But with daily pass, the app is ruined. If a comic was completed in 2017 I shouldn\u2019t have to spend coins to see a chapter that has already been released. I feel like if the creators and editors of this app continue making changes like this the app will surely go downhill fast if they don\u2019t change it for the better. The fast passes were completely fine, yes I got upset when I scroll the page up for the next chapter and see a \u201csee with fast pass\u201d but I was okay with it because it hasn\u2019t been published for years, webtoon has greatly disappointed not only myself but many many other users and I don\u2019t think the disappointment is going to stop until this issue is discussed and fixed.","111":"I would give 5 stars but honestly it needs more work. For one, the app doesn\u2019t sync your account with the web browser version, secondly I would prefer to choose the genres that I would get recommendations for because quite honestly I personally don\u2019t care for all the romance crap that\u2019s trying to be forced down my throat. I literally have only read action adventure webtoon son this but for some reason all I keep getting is recommendations for things that are popular with the female audience. Please allow me to choose what genres I would prefer to be recommended and for what demographic in the settings as a semi-permanent setting that I can change whenever. Gotta work hard for that 5th star, this app doesn\u2019t need to be perfect but it would be nice if it was more user friendly instead of it just being something only slightly more convenient to read at than a pirated site. At least stop shoving recommendations at me that don\u2019t pertain to what I read.","112":"So for whatever reason my account vanished. A big deal because I\u2019d spent hundreds of dollars fast passing multiple series over the course of about two years. So now I have no history, no saved series, have lost access to all the updates I\u2019ve already paid for, and lost about $50 worth of loaded coins. I\u2019ve been dealing with their customer service trying to recover my data, I\u2019ve even shown them screen shots of my bank statements demonstrating the $$ spent in their app. After dealing with them for a week they asked me to start over and resubmit my complaint, and I\u2019ve not heard anything from them since. Absolutely unbelievable that their app cannot recognize your phone and the fact that you previously had an account. Probably will have to give up on the app forever because as it is I\u2019ll have to wait 2-3 months until all of my fast pass series become free again, and honestly- I\u2019ll have lost interest by then. Moral of the story: don\u2019t give them any of your money. They\u2019ll just wait for you to be hooked and rip you off.","113":"This is honestly one of the greatest apps I\u2019ve used in a while and I love all of the stories people can come up with, whether it be one of the most popular or the least popular. I am definitely not one to draw, so I like seeing what others can do that I cannot. There\u2019s one minor issue I have though.. Webtoons started adding ads at the end of chapter and in the middle of the sliding menus of comics. When these ads started popping up, Webtoons started freaking out. When I would close a comic thingy to go back to my home screen, the screen would freeze, so I needed to close the app down to click on another comic. This gets frustrating. I don\u2019t mind the ads as much as the problems that came with them. I\u2019m actually glad the ads aren\u2019t the video that take up the entire screen, but when I get the the bottom and scroll over the ad and my finger brushes over it, it takes me to the app store or a website, which gets frustrating. Please fix!! Thank you.","114":"I love WEBTOON so much and always have, but this is gettin ridiculous. I know there are already reviews about this, but nothing is getting done about it in response, so I\u2019d like to add my support to this. A huge part WEBTOON so amazing is the free accessibility. For a completed WEBTOON to have to pay or wait for new episodes is utterly ridiculous. Not only does this make it limited entirely since we can\u2019t even have the episode free forever, but it also means we can\u2019t look back on our favorite WEBTOON and reread the best parts. Newer readers won\u2019t want to wait forever for new chapters and will lose interest in the comic entirely. This creates a problem for the readers because we either can\u2019t read the comic we love or lose interest to a good comic because of this. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough it also is a problem to the author of the WEBTOON, because they\u2019re losing readers because of this. This isn\u2019t a bad app, it\u2019s just making bad choices, that take away from the best part of it.","115":"Okay. Literally everything on this app is perfect. Amazing quality and story\u2019s. I\u2019ve been an avid user of Webtoons for years. I hope to make my own someday. I just have a small problem. I wish that there was a \u201cNot interested\u201d or a \u201cdropped\u201d option under the My Series category. Similar to how there is a Subscribed\/Recent tab. It would make finding the comics that I\u2019m actually interested in way easier. Of course all of the Webtoons are great but some just don\u2019t intrigue me so I stopped reading them. I would just like an option to see the ones I disliked. It would help readers get confused a lot less and not have to stop and ask themselves if they already read that, if they didn\u2019t like it, or if they forgot to read it. Understand? Only issue about this app. Really hope somebody sees this and tweaks it a little. Thank you for always giving good comics to us readers\ud83d\ude0a","116":"I was so bored and depressed. There was nothing I could do and then I discovered this app and holy crap! I didn\u2019t expect there to be any comics I actually found entertaining but there was. Now I literally wake up for the next free chapter of a certain series on some days since there is nothing left to do. Most of the content is completely free, although you will either have to pay for a chapter sometimes or wait a week to get it which is in my opinion far better than getting ads.\nThe only thing I would complain about is the fact it is sometimes hard to find a comic I forgot the exact name of and can\u2019t really find it again. Although this almost never happens with popular comics. If the specific comic you are looking for can\u2019t be found I\u2019d recommend looking it up online and entering the app from the website.","117":"First things first, I absolutely LOVE this app! I\u2019ve had it for a while and still think it\u2019s great. But there are 2 small things. 1) there is some kind of Starr Laboratories add that keeps popping up and I can\u2019t get rid of it. It doesn\u2019t have an X button so I can\u2019t close it, meaning I have to exit out of the app and then reopen it, and even then it still comes back which can be quite annoying. 2) every once in a while when I comment on a story, I\u2019ll get a reply with a link. The first time, I opened the link and it tried to give my phone a virus. Ever since I haven\u2019t opened any of the links. I noticed that the same person also replied to all the other comments with the same link. I\u2019m wondering if there were some way to get rid of this or have a filter of what you can post (i.e. the links). These problems have only started recently but other than that it\u2019s an amazing app, love it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","118":"I\u2019ve honestly had Webtoon for a long time and never really had a problem with it. The originals and canvas stories are amazing, never had a problem with anyone nor have I encountered problems to read a story. The only thing that I would like for this app to have is a profile. I have a lot of favorite creators and it\u2019s very difficult keeping up with them since some don\u2019t have social media so I can\u2019t really know when they make a new story. It would be amazing if you have the option of checking the creator\u2019s profile and follow them to get notifications of new stories! If that\u2019s possible then readers like myself don\u2019t have to look in search every certain amount of time and the authors don\u2019t have to waste a panel in telling us about the story! This is something that I\u2019ve been thinking for awhile now and obviously, you guys can modify it in something more functional!","119":"Hello Game Developers of WEBTOON. I am a young artist who wishes something from you. Your app is amazing! I truly believe that there are MANY more people to discover this App. However I have a question, I would love if you would respond. I mentioned I was a young Artist, and I use this app quite often, and I\u2019m in love with everyone\u2019s art styles and stories. Just a few minutes ago, I had an amazing story in mind that I wanted to make for WEBTOON, sadly...I can\u2019t. My question is, in the WEBTOON app could you please make it to where you can write your story, draw it, and publish it? I have been wanting to be able to do this for AGES. I\u2019m sure a lot of people have asked, and I\u2019m sure your busy, but if you could please do us all a favor and add this in? It would be so pleasing to finally be able to draw and publish on ( iPhone 7)mobile!! Please PLEASE do this for us!! I want people to be ble to enjoy my story. PLEASE...make this happen for us. Thank you.","120":"I\u2019ve been using the webtoon app since 2017 and It\u2019s honestly such a well organized and easy to navigate through app. I love how they recommend comics based on your interests and which type of art style appeals to you.\n\nThe one problem I do have with this app is the Daily Pass. I was around since before the era of Fast Pass and Daily Pass. Honestly, I\u2019m completely fine with the Fast Past, doesn\u2019t bother me too much. The Daily Past however, is a whole other story.\n\nApparently I now have to wait for stories I have already read and just want to reread. Why even do this? I\u2019m willing to bet that at least 60% of the people who go to the completed section of webcomics have probably read them. After going through the wild coaster of the comic we are then forced to wait even longer just to be able to reread it? This mechanic is honestly kind of dumb and I wish I could just reread some of my old favorites again without having to wait.","121":"Without a doubt this is one of the most enjoyable apps I have ever used. From the fantastic user interface to the endless array of comics, there's nothing to hate! Not to mention the fact there's nothing behind a paywall and no ads. As a cartoon lover I can say it's nearly flawless from the reader standpoint. I'd actually love if they added a donation section in settings, because with how much I use the app I feel they deserve some love!\n\nThe only issue I've run into is downloads are slow and don't work in the background, so you have to keep your phone unlocked the whole time in order to complete a given chapter download. I read most everything over data anyway though so that's minor in my book!\n\nEdit: lost a star because they started adding pop ups and advertisements at the end of each chapter. Would prefer banners, as it's a little less invasive to readers, and the option to pay for an ad-free experience. Thanks :)","122":"Webtoon has put me through a lot of emotional roller coasters but thats what makes it great. I honestly love Webtoon and the stories the authors can create and share with us the readers. Without the stories such as Lookism, My Dear Cold Blooded King, Let\u2019s play, and so many other amazing stories I wouldn\u2019t have anything to look forward to every week and that would be such a sad and boring existence for me. I want to thank the creators for creating something that brings so much joy to others, yes there are some things I wish I could change like only being able to subscribe to 100 webtoons at a time but I still love it the way it is. I\u2019ve told family and friends about this app and they\u2019ve tried it out and we\u2019re hooked on it and I\u2019m happy because I was able to share the joy I have with this app with my loved ones. But to make a long story short I LOVE WEBTOON!!!!! And it is a really amazing app so please support it please!!!","123":"Man I don\u2019t even know where to start I\u2019ve been here since 2015, I really loved how it was easy to access and easy to look at WEBTOON that are updating, but recently I feel a lot different of the site as I can\u2019t even re read WEBTOONs that I\u2019ve personally my read before, like I\u2019ve spent over 400$ on coins because I really enjoy the company and want to support it, but this daily pass is ruining me as I can even read series that I\u2019ve already read before hand, I\u2019m honestly so sad that this happened, there has never been a point where I thought WEBTOON was gonna be this way it\u2019s gonna literally turn into every other web comic app, coins for every episode that is free online literally on mangadex or any other grabber sites for manga\/Manhwa\/Manhua and etc, I hope webtoon can figure out a way to help better this and make the community happy over using daily pass which literally has no pointtttttttttt.","124":"A weird glitch happened two weeks ago where I couldn\u2019t get into my account and that webtoons was having \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d. I went to go log in the next day and my email (which was SAVED) on my log in was not registered. I use Facebook to log in usually so I figured it was that. When I logged in, all of my saved series, paid fast passes and RECENTLY PURCHASED COINS were all gone. Yet, the app still showed everything I\u2019ve read and how long ago I read it. I have contacted support multiple times just to be given the run around over and over again. I finally got a \u201cresponse\u201d and they tell me that my coins weren\u2019t purchased through the app. Um, my account is gone??????? I\u2019d love my coins to be back because it\u2019s a waste of $10 but now I have to spend SO MUCH MORE MONEY just to get back ALL of my fast passes. I will have to go weeks\/months without reading and supporting my favorite series and honestly I won\u2019t EVER trust giving my money to webtoons again. Now that I\u2019ve lost everything, nothing is really keeping me to this app. So unless my account is fixed\/comes back, this one star rating stays for good \u270c\ud83c\udffc","125":"I think you should be free to everyone I don\u2019t think you should have to wait to get to your next episode personally thinking that I like to read books through one straight line I do not like to wait a week or two to have my book ready I would like to read it right away but I do not know how I think The people think the same way as me  free to where you don\u2019t have to have to wait because I like my books right now coming from a nine-year-old \ud83d\ude1e i\u2019m disappointed I like the cursed princess club and I want to keep reading it but now I have to wait for like 17 days or 18 days or about a week or two I like my have my book right away like I said earlier in the message that\u2019s just my way of thinking about it.                  P.s I think the cursed princess club is a really good book and that\u2019s probably like the first book Aretta yeah that\u2019s the first book I read that I like.","126":"I just got this app recently, and it has great comics and manga. The reason I\u2019m giving this one star, however, is because of this new policy. Many authors have put hard work into their art that they are proud of. However, the new policy forces them to take down those chapters, which is unfair to readers. Its isn\u2019t fair that everyone was punished when a few people started reporting NSFW content. If readers were warned in the beginning for content that\u2019s 18+, then it is completely up to them wether they want to continue reading. So if they complain, it\u2019s completely their fault. It\u2019s especially unfair to newer readers, such as myself. I\u2019d be enjoying my reading, and all of a sudden, I go to a new chapter that was removed because of the policy, yet every older reader has read it. When I chec This not only makes me lose interest in this app, but also makes it a whole lot difficult for the readers as it stops them from drawing what they love, and forces them to draw according to some policy. If webtoon wants to do better, they need to remove this policy that\u2019s ruining our experience as readers. Using Tapas until things get better.","127":"Mk so I really like this app. I really love the stories they add in this app but one thing has been bothering me a lot. So im not allowed to buy the coins which i could use to read more chapters of stories but since i cant do that I wait a week for one chapter. This has happened to me many times and I absolutely hate it. So I wait one week to read the next chapter and when it\u2019s time for me to read the next chapter nothing happens. It doesn\u2019t show me the next chapter, then I have to wait another week to read it but I miss the chapter that I was going to read. So I won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in the story as much as I would want to. I was ready to read this one chapter for a week and was really excited because the last chapter was such a cliffhanger. But I didn\u2019t get to read it because of the thing I just said. Then I decided to write a review about this. So if the developers of this game see this review, please fix this. I would love that! Thanks and have a good day during this difficult time.","128":"I\u2019m going to keep this review short, the ads are annoying. It\u2019s not the fact that I have to watch ads, I love being able to support canvas creators buy just watching a short clip, but most of the time ads cannot load. I know this is a relatively never feature so I\u2019m sure it will be fixed soon, but it\u2019s really annoying when you wait for a week (or longer, or shorter, because a lot of canvas creators don\u2019t have set upload dates) and then when a new episode comes out, you have to wait until ads are removed because no matter how many times you try, you can\u2019t watch the ad. It does work sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t most of the time. I really hope this gets fixed soon, and this review was way longer than I meant it to be \ud83d\ude05. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this, and if you are a consumer don\u2019t be to mad at WEBTOON for this problem!","129":"Webtoon is a reliable app for fans of various genres in literature and fans of anime. This application allows readers to read for FREE in weekly installments to support the creator and this service. It also allows you to use FastPass to read an chapter (or episode) before the weekly installment but it costs money... the money you spend is then translated into \u201ccoins\u201d and as far as I know 5 coins are needed to unlock each chapter. Unlike other services Webtoon doesn\u2019t force the readers to spend money through advertisements or limitations! There are also opportunities in order to earn coins in challenges that appear occasionally (and they are well designed since they don\u2019t scam). If you want to donate and support the creators on this platform most have a Patreon. Finally, check it out and compare it to other platforms and you\u2019ll see why this review is so long even though there are many more features! Here are some stories that I recommend:\n- Tower of God (Fantasy)\n- dustininteractive (Comedy)\n- Safely Endangered (Comedy)\n- Cheese in the Trap (Romance)\n- Seed (Sci-Fi)\n- Bluechair (Comedy)\n- Not Even Bones (Thriller)\n- I Love Yoo (Romance)\n- The Gamer (Fantasy)\n- Kind of Confidential (Fantasy)\n- unOrdinary (Action)\n- Age Matters (Romance)\n- A Good Day to be a Dog (Romance)\n- Let\u2019s Play (Romance)\n- SubZero (Romance)\n- My Dear Cold-Blooded King (Romance)\n- Super Secret (Romance)\n- unTouchable (Romance)\n- Orange Marmalade (Romance)\n- Your Adventure (Comedy)","130":"Sooo I think my review was deleted or something, so now that I\u2019m calmer I\u2019m gonna explain myself again but more understandably. There is a new update coming out soon called \u2018Daily passes,\u2019 which you can use to read one episode of a completed webtoon. You\u2019ll have to wait a day for it to replenish unless you wanna pay. On my first time around I angrily reviewed it as bull because it seems to me there is no reason for it other than to be another money source like the fast passes or ads, which I am totally fine with. Artists are already releasing their comics for free, so why shouldn't they get ad revenue or charge those that want to see more sooner? But what peeved me was that this would soon be getting done to COMPLETED webtoons, those already fully released. This would mean the end of completed webtoon binging and I think turn off many people from reading completed webtoons if they have to wait to read completed webtoons when they can just read more current ones then. Also this annoyed me bc it won\u2019t discriminate between webtoons with short or long episodes.","131":"First I\u2019m gonna start by saying I love this app with all the great art and different stories that authors have made up and out for us to read. But in recent months many authors have been on hiatus without a reason to why or to when they are coming back, which is a bit unprofessional. Lots of people comment on webtoons asking when the author is coming back and others give hate to author for not posting, yes I understand that the authors have a life outside of webtoon but if they have put up episodes for us to read and suddenly stop for a long time then I think their webtoon should be taken off the app unless the author intends on coming back. Many webtoons have been gone for maybe half a year or more and has said nothing but kept quiet. So what I think is that if a webtoon has not updated an episode within 6 months it should be taken off the app because it is unprofessional. I don\u2019t suggest starting a comic and not finishing it, especially if it\u2019s popular and many people read it.","132":"when I first downloaded webtoon, which was about a year ago, i loved it so much! at the time it was definitely a 5\/5 star rating for me.. but that has changed. i greatly love webtoon and it's whole concept! there are so many creative authors trying their best to do what they can with their skills and creativity. the authors on the webtoon platform make comic solely because it's their passion! it's quite inspiring because of the art and great ideas for comics coming in the future\/comics that are progressing over time. sure there are more mature stories to choose from with stronger language and references to alcohol\/drugs\/etc.. BUT there is quite a big NSFW \n(not suited for work) fanbase, including myself, and it was SUCH a shame when the new policy was added. im very upset to see maNY good authors comics be taken down because of the mature scenes and NSFW content. i am also highly disappointed in webtoon for creating this policy and i do hope that they change back to their old policy! great content has been removed and the NSFW fan base is quite upset!! \n#BringBackTheOldPolicies\n#NSFW","133":"When using this app, I can tell that it\u2019s not just some strange money grab. I, got one, have never been the type to read comics in the first place, wether online or in person. WEBTOON has gotten me into that demographic of people who read comics. There are barely any ads at all. There is only one small ad at the bottom of each comic, just a simple banner ad. This just proves the developers and artists are trying to bring the joy of comics to people, rather than trying to make money. Sure, you can buy quicker access to episodes, but there really isn\u2019t any need for it, as the normal person can access everything without spending money, as spending only allows you to get something quicker, rather than waiting a few days for it. The comics themselves are very fun to read as well, with a simple UI a baby gold figure out. I\u2019d give six stars if I could.","134":"I love webtoon a lot I read it everyday. But the new policy has changed everything for the readers and the authors, like that\u2019s there art and everyday that have to remake everything they worked on because of this new policy. It\u2019s supposed to be about something for everyone to enjoy, not just if it\u2019s to much or if you don\u2019t think people will enjoy it. Trust a lot of people enjoy everything these authors put into there work before the new policy, like you are ruining what\u2019s good about the authors work and what people really want to enjoy, it makes no sense why the authors have to remove the art that they love so much that they have to change because of the new policy, that\u2019s why I give it a 3 Star rating because it\u2019s not enjoyable to see that a lot of stories I like are being put on hold to remake and or remove something from their story. Their stories are for them to create so the reader can enjoy and get a sorta feel to the reader and connect with them in many different ways.","135":"This is my favorite app and I check it whenever I can many. This app and many of the creatures are going through a very hard time right now. Recently Webtoon updated their policy causing many creators to close their content of limit it to no mature scenes. I know some people don\u2019t like mature things like s*x, gore, and violence but the authors all censor their work also give you a warning before hand. I don\u2019t know how me or many other users of this app will be able to continue with this. I\u2019ve gotten many notifications thinking a webtoon has updated but really it\u2019s just letting us know they will be cutting out many scenes or have stopped using webtoon to upload their stories. I hope the person who creates the rules and approves them will read this and change their new policy. I do not agree with this new policy and think webtoon should find a better way to fix their policy.","136":"I\u2019ve used this app for a couple years now and I love it, but recently they\u2019ve added a \u201cdaily pass\u201d to current chapters that were available for free, or to completely completed webtoons which makes this kinda frustrating.\nI hate this update and it seems others don\u2019t too, I used to wait till a few chapters became free and then read them all and then wait awhile again so I could read several in one day, now I have to come in every single day just to read ONE chapter, otherwise I won\u2019t be able to read any chapters. \nSometimes I have to leave town or don\u2019t have enough time to login every day to read just one chapter so I\u2019m missing out on chapters. \nIt would be great if they got rid of this update, I can understand completely why they did this but a lot of people are leave the site to read the stories on other platforms for free, if they got rid of daily pass it\u2019d be a lot better.","137":"I love this app. always have. now i rarely write reviews for anything but I feel as if this has just been taken too far. The stories are amazing and I love how they support upcoming artists and authors. To be completely honest, i can\u2019t stand the daily pass and coins but i understand it is necessary to pay the people who deserve credit. However, I am appalled by the enormous amounts of death threats people get away with in the comments of the stories. It\u2019s not just one story alone either. I\u2019ve read many stories that in the comments section, the readers consistently reply to others comments wishing them to kill themselves. Are we seeing the issue? This should not be taken lightly in any manner. I hate to say delete the entire comment section but if there is no monitoring then it\u2019s better gone. I\u2019m not even a strickler for monetization but it needs to be stopped before someone does indulge in self harm. This is very serious and I can go on, but i will simply leave it at that. This needs to be fixed, not soon, but immediately.","138":"I really love webtoon and I\u2019ve honestly had it for years, but since the added the daily pass I haven\u2019t been too happy. I\u2019m a \u201cfree to read\u201d reader and I don\u2019t spend anyone money on fast passes or anything when I could spend it on the merch or to support the authors. I like to go back and reread some completed series I\u2019ve really loved but now I can\u2019t do that because of the daily pass. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s in place anyway when I\u2019m sure you guys are making millions already from ads or coin\/fast pass purchases. It could take my up to 2 months to reread a certain series again all because of this new pass but I\u2019ve already read it and it\u2019s already completed so I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019d have to wait for. It just doesn\u2019t make sense webtoon! I really love everything on there and I love to read the series but I just don\u2019t like this new feature at all. Everything else is fine to me but this one I can\u2019t stand.","139":"So, I love this app. I think it\u2019s really fun and cool, however, I\u2019ve been having trouble with it. Yesterday the app was being really buggy and laggy and I didn\u2019t known what to do. So, I just deleted the app and downloaded it again. When I tried to log back in it said that a problem occurred and that I needed to try again later. So I just deleted the app and about 15 min later I downloaded it again and it said the same thing when I logged in. So I just waited for a bit and it happened about 3 more times. I decided to just give up and try agin in the morning. So today when I woke up I tried to log in and said the same thing! This is honestly really annoying because WEBTOON is one of my favorite apps because you can read free comics of all genres on there. So if y\u2019all could reach back out to me soon, that would be really helpful!","140":"Doesn\u2019t have tech support. Due to anniversary, I received 30 free coins,  but I can\u2019t redeem those. It says that I have more than 1 device registered, when I go to check and deregister one of them it shows only my phone I\u2019m using that I can deregister. There aren\u2019t other devices. And I still can\u2019t deregister other device that isn\u2019t shown. So basically if I deregister my device I\u2019m losing coins. Very disappointing that I can\u2019t solve this technical problem with tech support, there aren\u2019t email or chat where you can ask for help. I barely found \u201chelp\u201d that had no resolution to my problem, since nothing like my problem was listed there. I use your app for many years, almost every day and very loyal, but unfortunately can\u2019t get help when it\u2019s needed. Got harsh feelings now that somehow I was neglected by webtoon and will not get my 30 coins to celebrate it\u2019s anniversary.","141":"I have been a huge fan of the app, until my recent run in with the \u201cDaily Pass\u201d system. For any completed series, after the first 14 chapters, you\u2019re only allowed to read 2 chapters per day, or pay them to continue. These are often short chapters, taking no time at all to read through two. Maybe 5 minutes of your day. The series I just started would take me well over 4 months to read, at those quick two chapters a day, or over $75 in coins for me to finish the series at the speed I like to read. I\u2019m a fast reader, and read a lot at once, so $75 for a couple weeks of reading material is out of the question! I understand making money off the \u201cfast pass\u201d system, but this is ridiculous. It makes me hesitant to start a new series, never knowing when it will be completed and activate the daily pass system and cut me off mid series. I will have to look for another app to read similar style comics for the future, if this system stays in place. And judging by other review, it\u2019s been around for a few months now, so I doubt it\u2019ll be going anywhere.","142":"I used to love reading stories on this app. However, I can\u2019t find anything to read. I\u2019ve tried thousands of stories, and I only liked two. Although, I have to wait for each episode to come out. They take 7 days each! It\u2019s hard to wait! The first story I like is True Beauty, it\u2019s really good. Expect, I finished all the episodes, and I hate waiting for an episode to come out. I have to wait 7 days. And then, my favorite story is Odd Girl Out, that is the best story on the app. It had a ton of episodes, which is great. But I read so many a day, and now I have to wait a week per episode! And now, I have nothing to read. I wish they had more stories like those two, especially my favorite one, but the other stories of kind of...you know, boring. I\u2019m just not into the other stories. I tried all the popular ones, and I can\u2019t seem to understand why they\u2019re so \u201cgreat.\u201d I wish they had more like the only two stories I\u2019m reading. Because I have nothing to read, and I miss reading them...","143":"Before the new update. WEBTOON used to be really good to me, pretty much flawless. But after the update my app has been crashing, not letting me log in and keeps saying cannot load information. The buttons are almost non-responsive, I have to click multiple times to open something. If it even opens. It\u2019s really laggy and buggy like it wants to do the command but just can\u2019t. It also seems like the more I use it, the more it slow down. The waiting times to load something can be 1-3mins long. When it used to be almost instant. I love this app. It was always my go to app for anything. I will continue to love this app, even  now. Even tho my app has a leg in the ground. I won\u2019t delete it nor disgrace it. It got me through a lot. I\u2019m just disappointed on how much it got crippled. Please help if you have any ideas how to restore or resume it to its past glory.","144":"Since the recent software update, the iPad version of webtoon has stopped working. It worked beautifully and I enjoyed it VERY much before though. Since the new system update though, I will press on a webtoon and the webtoon won\u2019t load. Like everything is frozen and stuck except the loading symbol, which is moving as if it\u2019s loading. It said support for the iPad version had ended and it\u2019s last update was like 2 years ago. So, I decided to switch over to the iPhone version of Webtoon since I still love Webtoon and it\u2019s stories. Honestly, I don\u2019t exactly find it super iPad friendly and I already dislike using it for the iPad. You have to hold the iPad vertically the whole time and everything is smaller, even the art and the webtoon themselves because it\u2019s not fitted to the iPad (obviously). I wish there would be an update to make it a little more iPad friendly since they stopped the iPad support app or if they would at least update the iPad version to the new software update so people can have better quality of the app, no matter which device you may be using (like before the update).","145":"I would have to say no doubt this is the number one place to get the best comics from around the world. Not to mention the fact that the fan base around each comic supports, cares for, and helps the writer\/artist when the need it the most. I read a lot of romance on here I\u2019m a guy and I find it absolutely addictive it\u2019s like you know these characters the writer is making. You see how the artist improves his or her own personal style because of the nonstop way they make their comics. The creator or creators of this app are not only genius but a leader and brought a large group of people together all because of one thing we all love and that goes for all ages..reading and a ton of fantastic stories that we get to enjoy every week. If you\u2019ve read this far..please just get the app and enjoy! To the creator\/creators thank you so much I have something to look forward to every day!","146":"I\u2019ve never loved reading more than I did until I got webtoon. I discovered this app through and ad, and like most ads, I found it annoying, but it seemed interesting to me (which rarely happens to me) so I decided, why not, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. I consider myself a hopeless romantic so when I read my first webtoon comic, which was a very popular romantic genre, i\u2019ve never felt more excited, frustrated, or sad when reading something. I eventually read more and heart was just...I don\u2019t even have words to describe it. These comics are filled with amazing stories and emotion in my personal opinion. This also allows artists or whatever they prefer to be called a chance to put their work out there for people to enjoy reading. Overall this app has changed my life for the better and would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves manga, anime, funny comics, etc. \ud83d\udc96","147":"It's time for me to give up on Webtoon, this app has become a money-hungry app similar to Lehzin and Tapas. I joined Webtoon in 2017. One feature about Webtoon that I absolutely adored was how accessible everything was, everything was free, everyone could read it. Then fast-passes and even more ads can along, I was skeptical at first, but I agreed that creators needed more money for their hard-work. Then, daily-passes came along. It severely restricted Webtoon's accessibility. Daily-passes are so stupid due to their uselessness. Like, are you kidding me??? One chapters available for 14 days, then you have to use another daily pass for it?? What's the point?? Implementing it on manhwas such as Noblesse is even worse!! 500+ chapters!! I'm extremely disappointed in how Webtoon as aged. This is basically calling for pirators to come and snipe those comics. Ridiculous! You're bringing your OWN daily revenue and views down by implementing this. Common sense! You're a whole freaking company! Did you NOT think this through? I know I'm not alone in abandoning Webtoon. Good job Webtoon, you've lost your originality.","148":"This platform is great for aspiring artist to come share their works. I love to watch how WebToon nnurture is the young inexperienced artist. The progression in art form as a story goes on is a beautiful experience to witness. Also watching creators connect and network through their works is pretty impress. Like I remember when Kenny was just background music on one comic. Now look him spreading his music and even assisting in the creating of these stories. That's just one example of how the WebToon app has helped evolve so many young artist. There are so many different types of art, genres, cultures to appreciate and enjoy. There are even contest to help inspire the new creators to take that first step. Thank you WebToon for bring this to platform alive. It has helped so many, from the creators to the dreamers and even the readers who look forward to their favorite story being uploaded. I give you several thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","149":"Do not download the stupid app this app has put me through torture I will never speak of this app again this is the worst app I have a person in my whole entire life and I know what you thinking instead of complaining about it why not tell us why do you hate it so much well, it takes an extremely large amount of information to sign in and it makes you pay for almost every single story that you read in every chapter in the story it doesn\u2019t explain everything like most apps should all it tells you is the basic minimum and nothing else for example it\u2019ll tell you that you\u2019re not eligible to login but then it won\u2019t tell you why and then it makes the creator of the story look bad because they leave you off of this really big cliffhanger and then all of a sudden you have to pay for the last six episodes and if you don\u2019t want to pay or can\u2019t pay you have to wait almost 7 months just to read the last episodes depending on how many there are so I recommend not getting this app just for the onset of you maybe I\u2019m being dramatic but....","150":"I love binge reading WEBTOONs. The fact that I can\u2019t binge read my favorites anymore just makes me not want to read them altogether. If all the completed series (that includes future ones too) on WEBTOON get daily passes, I just don\u2019t want to bother reading on WEBTOON anymore. I love the fact that you have an option to pay to read more on uncompleted stories because as a person who can\u2019t pay for coins, I can wait. However, I can\u2019t do that with completed series. I can\u2019t pay to read those even though I have already read them. It\u2019s like reading a book but you have to pay to read the next page or wait a whole day. Of course that\u2019s also the case with uncompleted series, however from the start we always knew you had to wait another week and the people making the series has to have that time to make the next pages. Having a daily pass just doesn\u2019t make sense at all. I really love this app, but the Daily Pass just kind of ruined it all for me.","151":"When I first downloaded this app it was wonderful and I had very few minor issues. I could download things and read them in the subway, it would save my page and where on the comic I was on... One small issue was that sometimes my page wouldn't be saved offline, which was mildly annoying. Another small issue was that if I accidentally deleted a webtoon that I had downloaded, I couldn't redownload it. Again, these issues are minor and not very troublesome. However, a new feature called Fast Pass was added recently which is very annoying. Now you have to pay to read some comics or wait several weeks. Other than here 3 problems, this is a great app.\n\nEDIT: The new \"No NSFW Content\" policy has caused several of my favorite Webtoons to be removed, which I think is ridiculous. The people who report Webtoons for NSFW content have no right to do so because they had all been warned beforehand of it, and it is their own fault for exposing THEMSELVES to it.","152":"Believe me when I say that Webtoons is one of best apps I\u2019ve found in years. It contains amazing digital comics of all kind just for free, but it has recently made a decision that is ruining some of the comics. Comics that are read by a huge amount of their users. Artist now have to stop making their comics, remove them, or remake their whole comic all because of their new discovery policies. Yes, some of the comics have scenes not appropriate for younger children, but these scenes are CENSORED! The authors censor the scenes because of the policies from before, but they can\u2019t keep making their comics even if they are censored. These types of comics even have warnings shown before the reader is able to see the comic. It\u2019s not the artist\u2019s fault if kids decide to continue reading the comic. They are fully aware of what the comics can contain when they see the warnings and the description that say the certain ages that can read the comic. If you want a good way to fix this, than look for another solution.","153":"I\u2019ll make this short, I love WEBTOON and all the creators on this platform. I heavily dislike the way WEBTOON works, from how they charge your payment methods, which payment methods they accept and much more. For example, I currently have $5.97 in my Apple Balance but WEBTOON doesn\u2019t allow me to use it when purchasing coins.. instead it forces me to use a credit or debit card and that\u2019s completely unacceptable. Why should it matter how I pay for anything in the app? If I have the money on Apple Pay, or on a Gift Card it\u2019s still money. I also hate how often WEBTOON crashes or bugs out, I\u2019ve lost a substantial amount of coins due to the app crashing when attempting to make a purchase. For example I recently purchased 50 coins for 4.99 USD, and the app crashed. (My card was charged, but I never received the coins), I\u2019ve also spoken to Naver Inc about this and they refuse to A): give me the coins or B): reimburse me for the money lost due to their poor app.\nUntil this is resolved I will not be using this app again.","154":"Webtoon is an amazing service and there are so many comics to read! There are no pop-ups and the ads are minimal and not in the way. It keeps track of all the comics you've looked at and those you've subscribed to. There is an option to like each chapter in a comic to show support for the author! I just have one complaint. It gives notifications for when someone responds to your comment, but not when someone responds to a comment you've responded to. That bugs me because sometimes I ask someone a question and I want to be notified of their follow-up! The notifications for newly uploaded comics is always late, but not excessively so. It is useful for when a comic uploads at a time other than the regular (uploads at midnight, but for me it's at 10:00pm because time zone difference). But I really am grateful that so much work is put into each comic in creating it and in translating to English for us to read it for FREE!","155":"First off I would like to say is that I love webtoon It is a very good platform with free content and no ads. But I hate the new policy it is not good why must you change something that has no reason to be changed. It was very good lots of creators followed the rules so that they can share their story to people around the word and because of the new policy they cannot do it they either have to change most of the story or just quit the comic they worked so hard on. Especially now that the contest is going on many are participating and they quit because of the policy. I think the fix is simple change the policy before everyone or most of the fans of this site leaves to go and read the comics on tapas where all the authors are going to. I hope you will think about this and hopefully change the policy to what it was before.\n\n(P.s If you are going to change the policy back please let people like me subscribe to more than 100 discover comics I have to constantly unsubscribe to creators to add new ones or I else I will write down the titles on a paper which I don't like to do. Thanks.)","156":"WEBTOON has a bunch of amazing and talented creators. I\u2019ve been using this app\/website for graphic novels for over a year and I\u2019ve always loved it.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\n\nwith a new update, readers are allowed to purchase \u2018fast passes\u2019 to read some of Webtoon\u2019s sponsored comics ahead of their release date. I think this is a great way of supporting the authors and a smart business move for Webtoon. HOWEVER, as a loyal reader, the fastpass experience has ruined my time reading comics because I am not actively paying to read ahead. Fastpass users should NOT be allowed to comment on the chapters until they are published to the public. Majority of the comment sections are drowning in spoilers for chapters WEEKS ahead of their release. The comment section used to be a place where fans could discuss the story and talk to the author, and now it is rotting in Fastpass sponsorship and spoilers. It has really impacted my experience on WEBTOON in a negative way.","157":"I love WEBTOON and love the comics but daily pass is such A hUge problem  with this app. I understand how important it is to support the authors but this is just deterring people from reading their comics. I love to re read comics by binging them on a weekend but it\u2019s so difficult to do that now. Some of these comics are hundreds of episodes long and for the one I\u2019m interested in reading, it would take me over a year to complete it!! Also the daily passes don\u2019t stack so if you miss a day you lose daily passes. The function only allows those episodes to stay unlocked till after two weeks. So even if, after I finally complete the series, I want to read it again I\u2019d have to go through the whole ordeal again. At this point,  even if I really want to read the comic, the daily pass restrictions make the length of the series\u2019s so daunting that I give up reading them altogether. It\u2019s really disappointing how little this app cares about its readers and how little thought went into daily passes.","158":"This app is a service which allows artists and writers to create beautiful comics for weebs all over the world. The webtoon originals are out of the world amazing ranging from your rom-coms like Cursed Princess club to the superheroes in series like Unordinary and Kind of Confidential to horror like Sweet Home and Not even bones. The writers are truly amazing and always outdo themselves with every episode they write\/draw. And for the inspired artist or writer in us all is Webtoon Canvas where anyone can upload their story for the world to see. And who knows if you gain so much traction or webtoon loves your story enough you could be a webtoon original. This platform is so amazing that I can\u2019t wait to wake up on a Saturday morning and read The Kiss Bet or Eggnoid or the thousands of other comics at my disposal. I kid you not this app will change your life and it will be glorious. 10\/10 would recommend.","159":"Hi WEBTOON since you may be reading this I want to say that I kind of stopped reading comics and the stories after the policy The reason why is because how can people make stories if some parts aren't allowed. I was reading this comic and they had to delete everything because of it. I think people should do whatever they want they work hard on the script and drawings and it's not fair for you guys to make their stories disappear or change. I think the policy should go away. To fix younger people going to NSFW things you should put a sign on it and make it say \u201dWarning this NSFW 18+ only\u201d it could be that easy so people can have their stories and be free with writing it. Thank you for everything you guys have done and have a good day\/night but please take my complaint to an understanding that the policy should disappear and something else can fix this situation it doesn't always have to be a problem.\n\nFrom, \nKatelyn","160":"I have had WEBTOON for such a long time and I loved it! This review would have been an automatic 5 star, if it weren\u2019t for the new \u201cDaily Pass\u201d. I am almost certain many other users feel the same. WEBTOON had added an update awhile ago introducing \u201cFastpass\u201d, which allowed you to read a few chapters before they were released by unlocking them with coins. I was totally okay with this and actually liked it! You could earn coins during special events. I don\u2019t the new update containing \u201cDaily Pass\u201d, which only allows us to read 2 chapters a day after the first 6 chapters (including the completed webtoons). This basically had the readers with no coins to only read 2 ch a day vs when before when you could read as many chapters you wanted (that were out). Please change the app to how it was before this update creators! I really love this app, but this just made my heart sink a bit.","161":"I love this app. I think it\u2019s a great place to find cool new comics and manga that I can\u2019t find anywhere else. It\u2019s really good. But... I don\u2019t like the whole \u201ccoins\u201d thing. I don\u2019t rlly spend money on apps and stuff bc my parents don\u2019t like me too and I don\u2019t make my own money and all that Bi that\u2019s kinda a personal problem but I know a lot of other ppl can relate lol. I also know it\u2019s not fair for you to make an app and not get any profit so maybe use adds? I know that adds are one of the most hated things by ppl who play games but it\u2019s an easy way to make a profit without making us readers pay to get the comics. Let\u2019s say when we want to read certain episodes we need to watch a short add? It\u2019s a better price to pay than needing to buy things with money. I think having sponsors and getting rid of the restrictions would change this app for the better. \n\nThanks for reading if you did!","162":"I love webtoon, but hate the new policy because authors get their webtoons taken down because of a bit of NSFW that isn't even that bad. Anyways, all the webtoons are free unless u wanna pay to release future episodes that haven't been released yet but it's not that bad because you can just wait a week or a few days (depending on the author) to read the next chapter. Also while waiting for my other webtoons' next episodes to be released, I'll read other webtoons that have already released on whatever day I'm reading. Once I started reading webtoons, I got addicted and I spend all my spare time on webtoons everyday. I'm so thankful to this app and the authors that make the webtoons. I have become a hardcore webtoon reader during the past two years and the fast pass might be a bit annoying but I understand it's a way for the app and authors to gain profit.","163":"I love WEBTOON a lot. It\u2019s great in nearly every aspect. However, the addition of Daily Pass is obviously upsetting some readers, including me, who want to re read their favorite completed series. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous. Fast Pass is understandable, since it\u2019s paying to get ahead, but Daily Pass is paying to read something that\u2019s already been completed. An average comic with around 100 episodes would take ~2 months to complete, which is kind of absurd. Why would anyone wait 2 months or more to read an already completed series? It\u2019s understandable to resort to this for money and to provide payment for your authors, but honestly I\u2019d prefer plastering ads everywhere and then offering to pay a small fee to remove the ads. Or maybe you could incorporate a membership system that offers special benefits, such as getting earlier updates on your subscribed WEBTOONs. Daily Pass is just going to make your readers upset and eventually make them want to stop using the app and switching over to a different app.","164":"Honestly I rly enjoyed it! The app was fun I would read them when my mom told me to read so at least I could read something I\u2019d enjoy, When the app updated it completely changed they would you my give you a few episodes and than you would have to wait or buy coins tbh I liked the old WEBTOON better you wouldn\u2019t have to pay or wait you just could read the whole thing in one go rly I stopped reading mainly bc of the reason I still read it for stories and when I go back on there more episodes are there and o don\u2019t have to wait I will start reading it more if they daily pass update changes and where you don\u2019t have to wait I understand it\u2019s bc you need more money probably but you could of made it for some episodes and some free for the users that play free I used to play free when the update came I eventually ended up buying coins for it since I was getting impatient for the next episode. \nBy\n\u1d0b\u0280\u028fs\u1d1b\u1d00\u029f\u2626\ufe0e\ufe0e","165":"I love this app, but I am forced to make this kind of review.  Why can we no longer read a WEBTOON that has been free for years when it\u2019s completed.  Instead of using this daily pass business model, and using micro transactions, just do a subscription based model.  I have no problems with paying 10-15 dollars a month and many others won\u2019t either.  This whole daily pass model irritates me because I cannot read WEBTOON that my friends recommended to me for free and not having to wait.  They got to read it for free and once it\u2019s done no one will ever be able to.  For a 200 chapter WEBTOON you have to wait well over 200 day\u2019s just to finish it for free of course.  Having to pay 10 - 50 dollars to read each WEBTOON is also even more absurd.  This business model makes no one but sadists happy.  If you implement ads into the app like after every 5 chapters for example then that gives even more opportunities to make money as well as giving more of a reason to subscribe in the case of the business model I suggested.","166":"I absolutely love this app and I\u2019ve had it for a while and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered an ad on this app. But a few days ago I was reading one of my new favorites \u201cMy gentle giant\u201d, and it said I had to watch an ad first if I want to continue to the next chapter. So I click the button and it says \u201cUnable to load reward ads at this time. Please try again later\u201d. So I try again the next day, and it does the same thing. I try the next day after that and it still won\u2019t work. I talked to another user about it and they said they have the same problem and that if you update the app, the chapter should load. So here I am in the AppStore and I see no updates for WEBTOON. Now I\u2019m writing this review wondering what is going on. Developers please fix this issue. I really love this app and I want to be able to read comics without any trouble.","167":"Webtoons is without a doubt the best webcomic app there is. The app itself always works. There are thousands of comics to choose from. And ALL OF THEM ARE FREE! They only charge a premium for early access chapters, but they\u2019ll release a few weeks later. None of the comics are exclusively premium unlike Tapas and the Webcomics app. The only thing I wish Webtoons had was a better Tag system to be able to find your favorite comics. The only chance to find half the comics is they randomly get promoted by other comics or the seasonal collaborations that the artists do together. Otherwise the methods of searching by tags for types of comics are extremely limited. Especially for GL comics. Some authors have taken to putting something like [GL] in the title because otherwise there is no other search option to find them.","168":"It\u2019s a good app this is that I wish it had like a feature that it could reach to you because these books can be boring well I wouldn\u2019t say boring but like it\u2019s a good book will you see a good but it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know how or how it\u2019s going to be and like me I don\u2019t want to be I wish it had like you know a thing that can read to you because that would make it like a mental movie I feel like that would be good or if they can like show it and I kind a like a cartoon way then yeah that was that\u2019s all I have to say but like it is a really good App I do recommend downloading games unless you would like to read books you know so yeah I do recommend I do like to read books but sometimes the books I want to read I don\u2019t want to read them like out loud I want to like see in the cartoon so like but I do recommend less so yeah","169":"This app has many different Webtoon stories that you can choose from. The app overall is better quality than some of the other reading ones. First off, the sign up and all the chapters are free, unless if you try to read ahead using the Fast Pass. There are many different genres, and it\u2019s easy to navigate the app.\n\nAbout the Fast Pass, I think there should be another way to earn the coins than buying them. Maybe you can watch around 2 ads every day to earn 2 coins? That would definitely help. \nIt would be nice if you also reply to the top comments on the comment section. I mean, yes you can reply, but you have to scroll all the way to a single comment in the comment section. There\u2019s no way to reply to the top 3 that are displayed under the chapter.\n\nFor everyone complaining about the Fast Pass, just wait a week. The authors have to write and draw every single panel you see. The coins support the author, and it\u2019s really no big deal.\n\nI recently noticed that the app has been kind of laggy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just my device, but every time I click into a Webtoon, it takes around 2 minutes for it to load. \n\nOther than that, this app is great and I would completely recommend it to any reader! The art and plot of the stories are amazing","170":"I love this app 11\/10 but I find it sad that you can only subscribe to 100 comics. I read on webtoons pretty much all day (I\u2019m addicted to it) but it gets frustrating when you find a really good comic and you can\u2019t subscribe to it because you have already subscribers to a lot of other comics. Other that I love this app keep up the great work!!\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude1d \u2764\ufe0f\nOne problem that I have is with the newly Featured comics. For some reason, I can\u2019t see the thumbnail picture when I\u2019m in my \u2018recent\u2019 and \u2018subscribe\u2019 section. When I click on the summary of the comic, I can\u2019t see when it updates become the comic is always \u2018Up\u2019 (meaning a new chapter is out) and I know that it\u2019s not right because the comic doesn\u2019t update everyday. I have these issues with the following comics- Matchmaker Hero, Unlucky is as Lucky does, Cape of Spirits, Muted, Your Letter, and I think that all.","171":"I love the stories on Webtoon, i enjoy being able to read a whole story in one night. However there are series i have been trying to read but they are completed stories. You can\u2019t read these all at once, you get one episode a day. One. and during november you got more however i find it irritating how much they are trying to monetize everything. Yes the artists deserve to get paid for their work but not at the expense of the reader. Webtoon is starting to feel like Wattpad with how much it\u2019s being monetized and profited off of. I am also highly upset that free coins are only available during events. Tapas has a system set up where readers can get free ink to fast pass and pay for stories by watching adds and complete surveys. Webtoon does not have this. The only way to get coins is when they graciously hold an event where you can get free coins. Overall i\u2019m just upset with the management of the app, the stories are still wonderful and I hold nothing against the authors.","172":"Recently I got the app to read a few comics. Everything was fine until I relaunched the app and nothing was working. First off whenever I tapped on \u201coriginals\u201d it would take me to the page and permanently leave a notification on my screen. It wouldn\u2019t let me tap cancel on the notification and I couldn\u2019t leave to any other pages. I relaunched the app and I tried tapping on a comic I tried reading earlier and it took me to a white screen that just said \u201crate\u201d and a small plus sign far above it. Again I wasn\u2019t able to tap on anything else and I was stuck with that screen. I even uninstalled and reinstalled to see if that was the issue, same result. I also checked my screen to see if it was acting up, it wasn\u2019t, other apps worked perfectly fine and I even cleaned my screen. I hope this can get patched soon enough so I can continue reading and other than that big issue the app is completely fine.","173":"I love this app! I truly do and would recommend it to everyone. But, some updates are annoying me and I feel like it does not have enough variety. The update that really annoyed me was the daily pass. I honestly hate it because I don\u2019t want to wait to re read my favorite Webtoons. It makes it harder to read it all in 1 go and remember the storyline. The second thing that annoys me is the amount of Webtoons I get to read. I feel like there is never enough to read, even when you add canvas and the originals together. Finally, why is it that Webtoon has to keep the authors from putting it into the Webcomic. Instead, how about telling us that the scenes may be inappropriate or just give a reminder that the Webcomic is recommended for more mature people when you press the series. I am now fine with all but the daily pass. It just makes me want to break my phone.","174":"So I have been using webtoon for about three years now. Don\u2019t get me wrong I absolutely adore this app however recent issues have begun to occur. For example, I had purchased 100 coins and 50 coins both on different occurrences. I had 122 coins left to spend yet a couple days when I tried opening the app it asked me to relogin and put in my email. I obliged and put my account and password only to see that all my subscribed comics had been unsubscribed and that I had been left with zero coins and no purchasing history. I reset the app countless times to no avail. The app still retained the history of me reading the comics but had reset every other component. I\u2019m not sure if this only happened to me but I am very angry as I had spent money just to have it taken away.","175":"I love this app so much!! You get to read comics for free and a lot of other apps don\u2019t have that. But you can only subscribe to 100 WEBTOONs, or comics, whatever you wanna call them. I mean if you\u2019ve had the app for a while you\u2019re obviously gonna have a lot of comics that you like. Another reason is that when someone makes a comment on the comment I made...I couldn\u2019t figure out how to respond back...I feel bad if I don\u2019t answer back ..... but these are pretty minor things...\n \n The ONE BIG problem I have is that WEBTOON has started getting really strict about the NSFW comics......authors are forced to change their comics or stop it all together....... if someone doesn\u2019t wanna read it then they shouldn\u2019t be there......people enjoy these stories whether you like it or not....authors want to share their stories.....it\u2019s pretty disappointing but nevertheless it\u2019s a really good app and i would recommend it","176":"Starting off I just want to say I love this app and I absolutely love it. I\u2019m very happy that they\u2019ve started to implement things like fast pass and daily pass as well, it\u2019s a great way to support the artists while still maintaining a free app and I\u2019m very appreciative of that. However, a new feature in the canvas section is giving me lots of problems. I love the idea of watching an ad to read ahead, it\u2019s a great idea, but right now it\u2019s extremely poorly executed. There has only been one time where I was able to watch an ad to read ahead, and for the many times I\u2019ve tried after that it will not load an ad. I don\u2019t understand how that works, but I know that myself and a lot of other readers are upset about this because we want to be able to support the artists and read ahead, it\u2019s just very frustrating. Please fix this soon!","177":"The app definitely isn\u2019t perfect. Doesn\u2019t always save my recent chapter and I\u2019ll find myself rereading old chapters before catching back up for whatever reason.  And the events are not great if I have to say... reading events that are meant to promote newer series usually, great idea! Howeve execution is flawed. Offering 5 coins if you spend 5 coins is kinda pointless tbh and a lot of people don\u2019t have  extra income for fast pass unfortunately. Doing challenges for a minuscule amount of coins to read something like 30 chapters of various webtoons is also a thing, meanwhile they tend to be pretty popular comics, so people are usually already caught up with current chapters already making the challenges near impossible unless you\u2019re new to the app. \nKind of a scummy attempt to get people to buy coins for the most part, but that\u2019s each users choice of course.\n\nOverall I like the stories on here, but the app is ehhhhhhhh so-so","178":"Let's be honest not everybody is the happy go lucky person. I have been depressed for a while and I came across this app somehow lol. After looking into it and reading some of the stories it honestly helped me more ways than anyone can possibly explain! It's been hard but this app has been my outlet for crying and releasing my inner thoughts and feelings, which is hard when in reality you can't just express your true feelings without judgement and hatred sometimes. Especially with real authors and people behind the stories it expresses so many points of views and problems this world faces everyday in every society and person. I hope to whoever reads this downloads the app and try it out because it can help you or push you to say something that is eating at you; or if you just want some great stories then djenfrkcdjcnr its fricking amazing!!","179":"This app is amazing, but something that is REALLY bothering me is that recently I have been unable to like\/heart episodes of all the webtoons that I read. I\u2019ve searched on the internet but found no answer. Every time I attempt to like an episode, the heart turns white, but the like count drops to zero. I panicked when this first happened, but when I come back to the episode, the like count is back to normal but the episode excluded my like from before. Every time I try it again, the same thing happens. This really bothers me because even once the problem is fixed, I will have to search for my favorite episodes again to \u201cre-like\u201d them. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong, I\u2019m logged into my account, as all my subscriptions are showing. I would really appreciate if this bug was fixed, but this is still one of my favorite reading apps.","180":"Dear developers\n   It has come to my attention that you now don\u2019t allow nudity in your comics so the app is more user friendly but many many many people wish that you would get rid of that policy I for one am one of those people and we all wish that you would make it to where there is an option to show comics without nudity so that those who don\u2019t want to see it don\u2019t have to because it is in the human nature to want things you can relate too for some yaoi for others romance with lesbians and for the rest straight romance because whatever it is when it is nude it turns us on and yes if we want to be turned  on we could go to porn but people who download this app come to read and not watch I personally am a yaoi fan and enjoy comics like tanxrain good comic series and I along with so so many others wish you would change it to the way it was","181":"I love WEBTOON! It has so many reads and super cool stories with pictures of so many amazing art styles! My favorites are Unordinary, My Deepest Secret, Remarried Empress, True Beauty, Days Of Hana, etc. WEBTOON has FastPasses episodes where you have to spend money on coins and use those coins to read the fast pass episodes, so a really good reason why I LOVE WEBTOON is that WEBTOON gives you CHANCES to get FREE COINS! They give you so many chances at getting free coins! Coins are expensive but WEBTOON gives out free coins for just reading a webtoon story! It\u2019s awesome! I love free stuff! There are so many types of webtoons categories, like: romance, thriller, action, etc! I love this app! I mostly love the WEBTOON: REMARRIED EMPRESS, because they upload episodes every 3 days instead of 1 week like other WEBTOONs! The remarried empress WEBTOON is awesome! I won\u2019t spoil it but I suggest you read it if you\u2019re interested!","182":"I truly love this app because of the access to all the comics inside but I am disappointed in how struck the WEBTOON policies are for the comic authors. And if the romance comics can hardly show any form of PDA without getting flagged but some of the others are so bloody and gory that it\u2019s disgusting. I really wish they would get rid of the PDA issues. I mean come on can\u2019t you ask us if we want a mature option or something and if we say yes we want a mature setting then we can see everything. And if we Say no we don\u2019t want to see the mature stuff then it\u2019ll block the nudity and gore? Even put a password option in for parr\u2019s ya? That way everyone can get what they want. The people that don\u2019t wanna see the nudity or sex or gore don\u2019t have too. Or people like me that wanna see it can instead of being super disappointed with it. But that\u2019s just my personal option. I just thought it would be nice so everyone could have what they want individually.","183":"What really makes this app great is the creators and there are many and all are amazing so that makes up most of the stars.. the one missing is my slight annoyance with coins on completed comics\u2014 coins in GENERAL honestly (I\u2019m guessing you MUST buy them in order to even get them, I hope there is an option to watch ads to earn coins in the future), and a little bit of the interface: the MY page when viewing all the comics I\u2019m subscribed to, I\u2019d love it if I were able to sort it by A-Z or custom instead of the last one I\u2019ve opened, I could just slide the little tabs to the comics I care about most to least or there could be a setting to sort it into when the comics update day of the week (Monday\u2019s would be first, Tuesday\u2019s next and ones that don\u2019t have a schedule last, ect.). Other than this, it\u2019s only a slight nuisance, this app is really cool.","184":"I largely love this app, but lately it\u2019s been a frustrating experience due to new policies implemented by WEBTOON that censors artists in ways that art shouldn\u2019t be censored in. If a comic has a sex scene or nudity, then there are ways to indicate so so that sensitive readers can avoid it. But WEBTOON has essentially neutered complex and multi layered emotions and relationships on their site due to new policies. But I think what makes me the most upset is when WEBTOON has a contest which encourages new comic creation (which is wonderful), but also, as a byproduct, causes a lot of comics to be abandoned by their creators in hopes of winning a place of prominence or cash. So many readers were put on a hook and left there in various WEBTOON that are now essentially dead due to abandonment in favor of the contest. All updates now are essentially \u201cplease go support my new comic, I\u2019ll be putting this one down to create a new comic for the contest!\u201d It\u2019s disappointing and honestly makes me want to give up this app altogether.","185":"First off, I love that I get to read these comics so much and how much work and dedication these creators put into their work. However, with the app, one of the issues I find most annoying is the comments. I love that, as fans, we get to comment on episodes and communicate with each other about the episode, however, many times when I\u2019m commenting I cannot post it because it contains \u2018inappropriate or offensive language\u2019 when it in fact does not. I have read over again my comment that doesn\u2019t contain any sort of foul language and am still unable to post it. Yet I\u2019ve seen comments with curse words in them (not like I care about the bad words but why do I get so many restrictions). It makes me not want to comment on the episode even though I really want to. Idk how the algorithm is done to find out inappropriate speech, but it is not very good.","186":"I used to read a lot of webtoons when I was younger, but I stopped for a while because I got caught up with other things. I recently got it back and I've found some webtoons that I used to read, but I never finished, as well as new ones that I've really enjoyed. \n\nThere's just one thing. I've subscribed to maybe 15-ish webtoons and most of them, I haven't completely caught up with yet. For me, it would be a lot more helpful if there was a way I could organize the ones Ive subscribed to. For example, if I could sort all the ones I've subscribed to in my own order, it would help a lot with trying to find ones that I want to read. It's hard for me to keep track of which ones I just read, versus ones I still need to catch up on. It would also be useful to make folders for my webtoons, so I don't have to unsubscribe if I finish it.\n\nAnother thing is that when I'm reading webtoons, it won't let listen to music and read it at the same time. I understand that some webtoons come with sounds or music, but even the ones with those sounds and music won't let me listen to music.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this app and I'll definitely keep on using it, but these are just some suggestions and bugs that I think would make my webtoons experience a little better and convenient.","187":"So I love this app a LOT. I have read many webtoons on here such as Not Even Bones, A Good Day To Be A Dog, Untouchable, and many more. I love all of these Webtoons but what sets me off is daily pass, which is a system where you get about 10-15 episodes of a completed series for free and then you have to use daily passes, which you only get two a day, or you pay 4 coins per episode. And since I\u2019m a \u201cfree to play\u201d reader, and my patience runs thin, this dumb money grubbing system pisses me off. For example, I just came across orange marmalade, which is a completed series. There are about 120 episodes, so I\u2019d have to wait over the course of 2 months, or I\u2019d have to pay 440 coins. Blatant robbery! Let\u2019s take another example. Chews in the trap. There are 300 episodes. Let\u2019s say the first 10 are free, so that\u2019s 290. I\u2019d have to read over the course of 4 months, or I\u2019d have to pay an absurd amount of 1,160 coins! What is this Webtoon?!","188":"Hello there, I would like to state that this app is quite good and I really enjoy reading it, however there are a few things that bug me. First, the NSFW policy. It takes down episodes or entire stories because of NSFW content. While I understand trying to protect kids, this is the wrong way to do it. You take away episodes and stories that the authors have worked hours on and take away the reading experience for many older viewers. Suggestions to fix this:\n\u2022Have a way to input the viewer\u2019s age. If they are  too young, then block them from more mature stories\n\u2022change the age range to 13 and up. That\u2019s an appropriate age\nHowever DO NOT take down episodes and stories simply because of an age group. It is completely unfair to everyone else.\nThe second issue I have is fast pass. In an earlier version there wasn\u2019t any of that. I know you have to make money because this is a free app. But it is completely ridiculous to have to wait 15 days just to read an episode. Again, it is completely unfair to the readers who really enjoy these stories to have to wait 2 weeks to read an episode. Here are suggestions to fix it.\n\u2022lower the amount of days. How about only one or two days because 2 weeks is ridiculous\n\u2022get rid of fast pass and use the \u201ccoins\u201d for something else. Let\u2019s say maybe online collectibles. Little images of viewers favorite stories.\nThank you for reading my review, this review WILL be changed if these issues are fixed.","189":"I honestly really enjoy this app I\u2019ve had it for about 3 years now and a lot of the stories I\u2019ve been reading seem really interesting and fit for me for my age. Now, when it comes to the app itself it\u2019s not always great. For some reason, when certain webtoons are supposed to upload at a certain time, it\u2019s kinda laggy and it\u2019s taken 30+ minutes before for it to show up on my feed. Also, Fast pass is kind of expensive 10 coins for 99 cents?  I get that it\u2019s extra coin for the author, but I feel like you should be able to read 3 for a dollar instead of two. A pro of the app\u2019s functionality is that you can download webtoons, and read them if you don\u2019t have a WiFi\/ data connection. If you\u2019re wanting something to read such as a manga or graphic novel but don\u2019t want to pay a bunch of money, I highly recommend this app.","190":"I absolutely ADORE Webtoon! It\u2019s a space where creators have free reign to post their creative writing and drawings!! Plus, it\u2019s free!! To be honest, it\u2019s the highlight of my day most of the time. I love it!! But, with this new \u201cimprovement\u201d called the discover policy is not my cup of tea. It creatively restrains authors and artists from sharing their stories and ideas with the readers, who specifically come to those stories based off of their personal interests! It also creates spam and advertising, something authors on Webtoon do not want. It\u2019 discouraging seeing Webtoon restrict them this way, seeing as they provide the app it\u2019s income. On that note, I LOVE Webtoon and the stories it helps provide! What is dont love is how it is willing to damage and block others\u2019 ideas for their already predetermined plot. If you read this, thank you for your time.","191":"This app has romance,sci-fi, drama, horror, thriller, comedy, and more. The app even organizes when new episodes are coming\/are updated for each series you\u2019re reading. I love that you can comment and like each episode and you can buy fast passes. You can always search for a certain series or look in the \u201ccategories \u201c for what you want. You can also enable notifications for certain series which is great. This platform ,I feel, is also a great way to connect the authors of the series with the readers.I can\u2019t think of a way to make this app better. The number of \u201cads\u201d is great and overall 5\/5. I definitely recommend it to everyone\/anyone. So if you\u2019re wondering whether or not to get this app, please do, you won\u2019t regret it! \n          ~someone who recently got Webtoon( this app lol)\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","192":"This app is amazing. It has a lot of comics and all of them are very good. My favorite one so far is Down To Earth. I never would\u2019ve thought that I would like comics so much. I thought I wouldn\u2019t like comics until I decided that I was going to download this app. I went through it (Down To Earth) so fast. I started like a few weeks ago and I\u2019m already on episode 61. However, since I\u2019m on a high chapter, it ask me to give them coins from the app or wait for four days or higher. It asked me to do that when I was trying to get on episode 62. Really. I\u2019m not gonna wait four days just to get to another episode. I\u2019m not rushing the creator (the person who made Down To Earth)in any way I\u2019m just saying that can you please lower the days I have to wait? Or maybe can you ask the creator to make the episodes longer? Pls","193":"Hello! This is honestly the GREATEST app out there for webcomics, and I have been using webtoon for over 3 years I believe. I only have 1 problem with the app though- \nI have the app on my tablet AND my phone, but episodes I\u2019ve read on my tablet are showing up unread on my phone! This is awful and confusing for me when I\u2019m away from home and reading on my phone. Please make it so that accounts sync chapters too! I don\u2019t want to have to swipe through every chapter to make sure it says read on the opposite device I read on last. I know it syncs your subscribed and your comments, but PLEASE sync chapters that have already been read!!!!!! I would SUPER appreciate it! Still giving this 5 stars because this is honestly my favorite app that isn\u2019t social media and works great besides this little issue.","194":"Ive been reading Webtoon for a long time and it\u2019s my favorite comic app, but recently it has changed in a way that\u2019s really frustrating. The reason I liked webtoon so much is the fact that it had plenty of stories that I didn\u2019t have to wait to read. The recently when I went to rewatch some older series that I have already read, and one I was in the middle of reading and now I have to wait for the daily pass. It\u2019s really inconvenient, and it worries me that webtoon might slowly start to become like other free comic apps. It has amazing content, but the daily pass function is annoying. I know I\u2019m ranting a bit, but I\u2019m a little angry. I wanted to reread Days of Hannah and A good day to be a dog. I was in the middle of reading untouchable. Well yah it\u2019s still a good app, but it\u2019s got me a little upset. I\u2019d still recommend it to people just not as enthusiastically anymore.","195":"This app is a good way to read and find new things you like, like romance, drama, comedy, and even action! I have been using this app for maybe 1-2 years now and I absolutely love the creativity of the webtoons. I also love the update where they are giving more challenges to earn more coins instead of buying them, and as a 13 year old with not much money, I love it! I see that some people are not fond of the completed series update though with having one daily pass, But i think that it kinda makes it fun in a way to try and still have that feeling of a cliffhanger and seeing what happens next, even though it is already completed. Overall I love this app and the stories on it and have found myself using it most of the day. I would give this app a 5 star rating all day!","196":"I\u2019ve had WebToon for over a year and love everything it has to offer, with endless stories to read and enjoy. The one thing I have to say I don\u2019t like is the new policy that\u2019s just been made that effects a lot of the creators in the Discover section of this app. The new policy very much limits what types of stories and content that is put in the app that is just unfair for artists that want to make a story their own way. The mature content specifically is going to be nonexistent in this app since they can\u2019t even censor thanks to the new policy. I just wish it could go back to the way it was since lots of creators and artists will likely leave this site and take their story elsewhere even if they love using WebToon. It\u2019s just sad to see from an artist perspective, and I don\u2019t see why this policy had to be in place when it wasn\u2019t really a problem to begin with.","197":"100% get this app you can read comics when ever you want and you don\u2019t have to sign up it\u2019s amazing there is so meany comics to chose from and you get notifications when an Author update a story the only suggestion is to rethink the new policy I just want to thank the creators of this app this really help me in meany ways thank you so much and I mean it from the bottom of my heart this is the best app I have no joke half the time I am just reading these comics and I love the way the creators designed the app it\u2019s really easy to work get logged on or just skip if you don\u2019t want to sign up you can even pick the category of story\u2019s you want to read like fantasy and all that I just really appreciate the work the authors and the creators put into this and \n( btw don\u2019t mind my spelling errors and punctuation errors )","198":"I really like this app, I never like to read and with this app I read all the time. I never knew I like reading but it\u2019s just that after you read about 60 or 80 episodes it makes you wait, I don\u2019t really like that because what if you don\u2019t have money or time to pay for coins they should just make it like a regular comic instead and let us read it for free instead of us having to pay for it to read the next episode it\u2019s kinda frustrating since you have to wait  more than 5 days to read a episode that was getting  interesting at first until you had to wait for a long time or pay to get coins to unlock it sorry but in my opinion coins aren\u2019t needed and they should let us read how many episodes we want, instead of us buying coins and unlock or waiting for days just to read on episode and then waiting more day to read the next.","199":"Heyllo Creators Of Webtoon! You\u2019ll probably never read my review, but I\u2019ll write it anyhoo. My first request is to remove the part in the \u201cCreate An Account\u201d where it asks to send an email. Some of your users don\u2019t have an email inbox. So they can\u2019t receive an email. I can\u2019t do that either ;~;. So if you could please remove that, I would be very happy. My question is, why do people without an account not make a comment? You could just label it as anonymous like they do on tumblr. One more request before I bid you farewell, can you put an \u201cup\u201d in green letters next to webtoons that have updated, even if it\u2019s on the recent read ones and not downloaded. That would be helpful to me so I don\u2019t have to look through all my BL webtoons to find which one updated. Anyhoo, t","200":"I absolutely love the concept of fast passes and I really love the app itself. But one complaint I hate has to do with the fast pass, how for example if you unlock 2 fast passes, you shouldn\u2019t still have to wait 21 days to unlock a new chapter every time you buy a fast pass the one\u2019s you haven\u2019t unlocked should descend. For instance: Chapter 18: 7 days to unlock (uses a fast pass) Chapter 19: 14 days to unlock (uses a fast pass) Now that you unlocked these two chapters Chapter 20 should be unlocked in 7 days it\u2019s kinda ridiculous how I\u2019d have to wait 21 days it makes me not want to buy the fast pass because when I do read the chapter I barely remember what I was reading 21 days ago and going back to read previous chapters is pretty annoying . I really hope they fix this because I Love this app.","201":"For people who don\u2019t know,  WEBTOONS is an app that allows you to read ordinary peoples comics, support the authors by giving money, subscribing,making comments, and leaving likes on not only the comic itself but other peoples comments(and disliking if you really don\u2019t like that comment or respond to them). I love how WEBTOONS is just a bunch of comics made by creative people. It seems like everyone can do it! Well... not exactly, this app only allows people with computers to be able to make comics and I know that some of us don\u2019t really own computers. So I got thinking If you can read webtoons in every device; could you also please allow people to MAKE them in every device as well, including phones. That\u2019s all I would ask, otherwise I have nothing else and I really hope that this happens I would probably not be the only one appreciating it, thanks.","202":"I love reading from the Webtoon App. The stories I\u2019m able to read, for free, are beyond amazing. They\u2019re beautiful, well written, & leaving me feeling all fuzzy inside. It\u2019s incredible to be able to connect on this creative level. But, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not too happy with the new policy of mature content being taken down. When an author creates a story they include the \u201cevents\u201d because the story needs to go that way or they just want it like that! It\u2019s kind of a let down to miss a gap in the story all because they have to censor the content. I\u2019ll still continue to read the stories I love, the fast pass in my opinion is appropriately priced. I hope in the future, the authors on this platform have more creative freedom. I imagine having to publish a story not how it\u2019s picture in their head, hurts them on a level.","203":"Though I understand it to a certain degree, I found that this new policy is making things harder for WEBTOON creators. I love reading on here and personally it doesn\u2019t affect me but I have noticed a lot of webtoon creators struggling with the new policy. I believe it is obvious that some webtoon have 18+ content due to warnings of which you answer yes or no to confirm your age and then warnings in the descriptions. Many webtoon creators have resigned to making their readers pay to read there stories. My mates and creators I know and have spoken to are really annoyed with the new policy and think it could have been handled a different way. I suggest that they have a talk with some of the affected creators as to what they should do to come to a compromise. Through all this the app have many other creators on there that have nice webtoons  that do follow webtoons guidelines as well. With all do respect \n Izabella","204":"I love webtoon very much and I enjoy reading new comics everyday! But so much has changed like the nsfw policy I mean really? Why would you stop creators to stop showing their work! Isn\u2019t that what webtoon is about? And instead of banning nsfw comics you should try a different approach. Example: All webtoon creators must giving the audience a warning before starting the web series if not there shall be harsh consequences. In the warning you must bullet all the things that make your comic not suitable for children. (Bad language, nudity, and etc) You shall have 3 chances. The first strike will prevent you from posting for a week. The second strike will preventing you from posting a month. The last strike will ban you from posting your webcomic. \n\nNow that was just an example but I believe that webtoons should think about this it will be both helpful and informative to our web comic creators\n\nHope you consider this as your next step","205":"Absolutely one of the best apps I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of downloading! I\u2019m so glad I found this and downloaded it! I\u2019ve had it for  y e a r s  and I still love reading the comics. It\u2019s easy to navigate, you don\u2019t need to pay anything to read, you can keep up with the web comics, you get notifications of when they update, and you can reread all you like as well as post your own! My only qualm with this is that if you use more than one device, it won\u2019t show you where you left off on the other device. If you read up to chapter 20 on device 1, device 1 will show that, but if you stopped reading at chapter 15 on device 2, device 2 will only show you read up to chapter 2 :( \nBut everyone\u2019s comments are always entertaining and relatable! Just watch out for spoilers!!!","206":"I\u2019ve had this app for years and I love the stories I\u2019ve gotten to read and am in the process of reading but I\u2019m beyond disappointed by the number of creators that don\u2019t feel as though the can continue their stories because of contracts or restrictions put on them by you. Fans want them to come back and stories are left hanging. While there\u2019s about 3 series that I\u2019m reading rn that still update there\u2019s probably 10+ that just stopped updating because of problems with you. It\u2019s sad and honestly a slap in the face to the creators and readers that have used you for so long. I don\u2019t know details of the contracts you have with creators but you need to figure something else out because I\u2019m surprised you still have as many readers as you do utilizing this app after having so many amazing comics taken away. As soon as the ones I\u2019m reading now end or feel like they can\u2019t update anymore I\u2019ll pretty much be leaving with them and I\u2019ll be shocked if thousands\/millions of others don\u2019t also.","207":"I understand that this is a business and they need to make money. I had thought adding the coin system to get a glimpse ahead at future episodes was a decent compromise without putting too much of a strain on more casual readers, but now WEBTOON has added a daily pass system on completed comics that is quite frankly ridiculous. Having temporary access (14 days) to chapters unlocked one day at a time or with real money is off putting, especially to those who have favorite stories they want to reread, as this makes it a much less enjoyable experience to have to wait for pieces of a story they already know. And not only that, but it deters readers like myself, who enjoy reading a story from start to finish in a timely manner, from branching out into new webcomics as I know it could take months to compete a story that has been fully uploaded for years. If this site\/app continues on this trend I will definitely be looking elsewhere for content.","208":"Don\u2019t get me wrong i love the app and its wonderful creators! Ive been using webtoon ever since it started , i dont mind the coin thing as long as its supporting the artists and authors that make these stories. And i really could care less about the NSFW policy, but the thing that annoys me the most about this app now it the CONSTANT crashes when im reading webtoons! Some days i can read all my updates and even a whole new webtoon before it crashes, and other times i cant get past more than one panel on an update before it freezes . Ive tried everything! I took away all background apps, i let it sit there for a bit while it was frozen,and i even restarted my phone once! Its infuriating, even with other apps by line i never got problems with crashing. I hope they fix this soon because this is a genuinely good platform to share content like this, it\u2019s just disappointing how unstable the app became","209":"I\u2019ve been on WEBTOON not long, but it\u2019s easy to get the gist of it. I love the authors who try their hardest to make the arts. There\u2019s a lot of good parts about this app, you can search easily at what kind of genre you want to real (I mostly like the romance, and slice of life), you\u2019re allowed to comment, and the app is free. The only bad thing is that I recently have been unable to use my Facebook account, I checked in the recent reviews if anybody had the same issues and it seems that there was, which made me kinda unhappy. Without signing into my Facebook account I can\u2019t like or anything like that to the authors, and making a new account would mean that I would have to find every story I have subscribed too, and I have a lot. Sorry for the long rambling. I still like the app and I\u2019m still able to read the comics which is great.\n\nWell that\u2019s all I can say, please fix the issue I really want to be able to read more WEBTOONs.","210":"I love this app, I\u2019ve been using it for years. However, since the last update there has been a bug with ads. I would open the app like usual. Everything is normal until I start reading a webcomic. After about 5-10 minutes of reading, an ad pops up covering half my screen. There\u2019s no way of closing this ad either. So, I have to close the app and reopen it. However, the same exact thing happens. After 5-10 minutes of reading, an ad pops up covering my screen. I tried deleting the app and re-download it, but I lost the 10 coins I had instead. The problem has been there since the last update, and deleting and re-downloading the app doesn\u2019t help. I lost 10 coins, and I still get ads covering half my screen. \n\nPlease fix this bug","211":"I love this app and still do but one day I opened the app and started a episode and a ad came up which I\u2019m use to so I waited for it to end but another ad came up so I waited some more, but it continued playing ad after ad so I closed it and opened it again and tried the same episode and it bid the same thing. Now I can\u2019t open any episode without a endless loop ads, and I\u2019ve been trying for weeks.\n\nThis is not the first time it has happened to someone using this app and it\u2019s even a known glitch to a lot of users, but the creators act like we\u2019re being over dramatic and spoiled little kids without even looking in to it don\u2019t get me wrong when I could watch stuff it was a great app a 5 star rating but know I want to give it a 1 star rating because I can\u2019t even watch a single episode.","212":"This app is really great. I love all the stories people create.. It really boosts the artist\u2019s creativity and the reader\u2019s imagination. This app is for many types of readers and interests, I really like that. Whether you want a good ol\u2019 horror story, a romance, comedy, or just a lick of life, all the stories are absolutely great, cheers to the artists and creators for that. The only thing I dislike about this app is the \u201cfast pass\u201d. I get how this is how you can make money on a free app like this, but the wait is quite long to me. I much prefer to wait 3-4 days instead of a whole week. Boost up the cost of the episodes if you like. If the creator has the episodes done, then i would like it to be dropped in 3-4 days. The cost could bump to 10 coins, hell, even 15.! I just want a shorter wait time. That\u2019s all.. Over all though, this is a GREAT app!! I\u2019m definitely obsessed!!","213":"I open webtoon at the least, once a day. Everything is free to read, ads arent in an obtrusive place, vertical scrolling is -mwah- beautiful. Not to mention the comics on here are all super great. I read through a lot of different genres and whoever decides what webtoons to feature does a great job picking because most of the ones I start, I dont stop. After being on webtoon for ages, I finally decided to write a review just because I wanted to comment on the coin system. Reading ahead of what\u2019s published is available on some of the comics for 5 coins (50cents) which is not bad at all- but I think this system sets you up to fail because you\u2019ll either have to go the next week without a chapter or continuously pay money to keep reading every week. My advice-just don\u2019t read ahead.","214":"Webtoon has been one of my favorite apps for a while. There are so many varieties of stories that you can\u2019t find in libraries that are absolutely phenomenal. Comments on episodes allow readers to share thoughts or ask questions and explain, which can be entertaining and helpful for the readers and authors. The only thing that I don\u2019t like is the policy for mature comics. To read them, you still have to confirm that you\u2019re 18, but Webtoon won\u2019t allow any graphic scenes either way. This sometimes gets in the way of dialogue, making it confusing for readers and I would assume frustrating for authors. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more with their policies but I\u2019ve never read into it, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more difficulties on that area. But overall I love this app and its variety.","215":"I\u2019m am going to admit that although I do enjoy webtoon and the fact that it\u2019s open to everyone but recently there has been a new policy saying that people can\u2019t post webtoons with nsfw and in my opinion it\u2019s absurd it\u2019s not fair that people have to stop creating nsfw and change the whole content of there series. Another thing that isn\u2019t fair is sure there may be kids reading but there are still a decent amount of adult and teens hoping to read as well and by taking away nsfw I believe that great authors will be going to other websites to post comics and there will be less and less adult reading and that\u2019s a good quantity of people. I believe there are plenty other ways to sort out the age groups so please reconsider taking away nsfw and and find another way of sorting out the age groups","216":"Okay, here we go. THE NEW POLICY HAS TO GO. I got Bebtoon awhile ago, so it's hard to remember if they make you tell them your age, but if not, they should. I know that many are under the age of 18, but the age limit SHOULD be 13 or over, and certain comics with \"inappropriate\" scenes should also have age restrictions. Like, beside the name should say, maybe, \"18+\" and people under that age would leave if alone, or if they really don't mind profanity and are under 18, could read. Any people complaining about it could just be told to leave, instead of complain. Right now, I know for sure a favorite comic of mine has a bit of profanity in a few chapters, and I would be heartbroken if it got taken down, or changed. I'm recently reading a Webtoon that had to completely change their whole plot line to fit the new policy, and I find that unfair. Please consider changing the policy.","217":"I love love love this app!!! It has so many story options and it also has the download (sadly for the webtoons only not the discover ones) option and is really useful too. I love downloading things so I can read them on road trips. \n\nThe only thing I wish was also in the app would be the ability to sort the comments you leave. In the stories themselves you can leave a comment and read others. The ones you read can be sorted by \u201cnew\u201d (most recently commented) or \u201ctop\u201d (meaning the ones with the most likes). Under your profile you have recents, subscribed, downloads, and comments. The only thing I wish was different was the ability to sort your own comments. \n\nAnyway I loveeeeee this app and The authors and stories i have found have inspired me to try and make a comic. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","218":"To put into perspective how bad the daily pass is; noblesse is a completed series on WEBTOON with 543 chapters. WEBTOON gives you 2 daily passes for this story per day. That means you are spending 271 days which as at a rate of 31 days per month is 8.75 months. Keep in mind: that is if you are reading EVERY DAY. The daily pass system not only shafts you if you binge read by not allowing it but it also increases the chance of others pirating the content. It doesn\u2019t make people want to pay for it especially considering that most of the stories I read on this app can be found for FREE and be binged on other apps with no daily block. Noblesse is an extremely long story but even shorter stories get shafted by this daily pass. The app boils down to \u201cwhy read it here 10x slower when I can binge read it on any other app and not waste my own time\u201d. Other wise it\u2019s a fine app.","219":"I\u2019ve had this app for about three years now, and it was an amazing app. Until they started adding new features. I didn\u2019t pay any mind to fast pass because I think it\u2019s a cool feature that allows you to read unreleased episodes and support authors. But daily pass?? What even is it?? I took a break from WEBTOON and when I come back, suddenly you have to use daily passes to read completed WEBTOONS? And the episodes are only available for 14 days. After that you have to use ANOTHER daily pass to reread it? Now you can\u2019t reread webtoons that you\u2019ve already seen or binge read. I  personally think you should just get rid of this new feature. Or at least have the episodes be available once you use a daily pass on them. Have you even read your reviews because people are clearly not happy with this. I love you WEBTOON, but you\u2019ve gone downhill with this new feature.","220":"This app is wonderful, but I get logged out of it randomly, and when I want to change my password the app says my email isn\u2019t \u201cregistered\u201d. There\u2019s no other email I\u2019ve used to log into the app, and I even get the link messages to my email, but the app says, yet again, that my email isn\u2019t registered. This is very frustrating because I tried the link again to change my password,and this time it said there was an error. So the link either: sends me back to the log in screen or to the webtoon website as if I\u2019m creating a new account. I don\u2019t want to create another account, I\u2019ve already lost one before and I had re-search for all of the webtoon\u2019s I had in my previous account. \nBesides that, webtoon is a pretty good app where many artists can share their art styles and stories with others.","221":"I\u2019ve been with this app since the beginning. I loved it and especially with the fact that it was a free to read app. I usually wait a little while before checking on updates to be able to read multiple chapters at once but today I checked and noticed you have to purchase coins to read to the current chapter? I was extremely disappointed when finding this out. I was hoping webtoons would stay as a free to read app rather than become apps where there\u2019s in app purchase. I know they\u2019re trying to make more money for both themselves and the author but this is severely disappointing to me, as a reader. This takes away the enjoyment of being able to check updates and being able to read them right away. Not only that there\u2019s no way to achieve free coins compared to other apps although you have a wait time per episode. I just hope they\u2019re able to revert to their old ways for everyone\u2019s enjoyment.","222":"I understand that translating takes time and that some WEBTOON are still being drawn as they come out but it\u2019s so hard to keep track of the storylines. There\u2019s so many good stories but I\u2019m very forgetful and the amount of time you have to wait for some episodes to be free to read and for series to come back make me unable to follow the story as well and I often get characters\/scenes mixed up the completed stories that have daily passes are bothersome as well because I want so badly to read them but I will have forgotten which ones are the daily pass ones and then I\u2019ve missed a whole day\/episode I could\u2019ve read I wish there was a way to organize the WEBTOON yourself as well rather than just recent subscribed and downloads other than that the stories are so addicting and there\u2019s so many all different genres \u2764\ufe0f","223":"I really wish that the time would be hours instead of DAYS. I\u2019d honestly be fine if I could ACTUALLY BUY COINS-but for some reason I can\u2019t see to since I\u2019m on an apple product (i-pad) and it only allows coins to be bought on iOS. Please fix this or at least try to so that I can enjoy my stories. I would of given this app all 5 stars, but this made me doubt my choice to install it. I even checked the amount of time it\u2019d take to read another story, I was thinking it\u2019d be around a time like, say, an hour or two or three, but when I looked up my favorite stories (which by the way, is only TWO) and added up the times, it totals 109 DAYS............\nI\u2019m not very happy with this and even if I tried, I couldn\u2019t do anything about. Please just adjust your app to take money from apple products as well. \n\n                     Thank You.","224":"Webtoon is an amazing app where artist show there passion and I love seeing all the different styles and stories and how you don't have a certain amount of time where you are able to read again. But on the other hand Webtoon started messing things up. Such as two new updates that happened. The first one is where there is an add at the bottom and it started to make the app slow and then If you finger brushes against is boom you are on a new screen and then had to find your place in the story again and it would bug the app out where it would send to the home screen. The second update made it so there  are no R rated comics, I didn't mind it too much but a lot of artists who drew like that just lost their job because they couldn't continue the story. So Webtoon was a great app and still is but the updates sucked","225":"The Stories on here are so interesting! Some of the stories are a little... too interesting... the app is for 12+ age which means there is DEFINITELY going to be children reading these webcomics. As some one who is under 18 I can tell you that some of these webcomics were clearly not meant for readers my age. I also don\u2019t think that the solution to this problem would be to kick the kids out because that\u2019s just sad, but make WEBTOON a more appropriate app for readers 12+! Some people are saying to make WEBTOON an 18+ app which I think doesn\u2019t make sense because when having young and old readers attracts more people to the app and makes it more popular! So I can understand why you don\u2019t want to make WEBTOON 18+ and I agree! But you should make it more appropriate for 12+ age...","226":"Webtoon is a very nice app, the design is nice, there\u2019s a large community that has a lot to contribute, it doesn\u2019t glitch often, A LOT of stories to choose from, a lot of amazing art from the authors, and so much more. Every webtoon story updates every week or more than that sometimes! And everything on there is pretty binge worthy in my opinion. At first I had a rough time finding what I liked, so here are some suggestions:\n\nUnOrdinary\nBlueChair\nLumine\nTrue Beauty\nLookism\nGhost eyes\n\nBut there is one thing that frustrates me all the time!!! The horror genre gets no recognition in webtoon canvas and sometimes the originals are highlighted if we\u2019re lucky, but it\u2019s basically like they don\u2019t exist! I really like horror, and I think webtoon could earn more readers if they showed a lot of the canvas and originals horror series. I\u2019ve read a lot of them and some have millions of people who have the read the author\u2019s series!! It\u2019s crazy how underrated theses stories are. Webtoon!! Please highlight these stories in canvas appreciation!!! I really hate when things are underrated like this \ud83d\ude2a  \n\nOther than that this app is great and I love it, J would definitely give a five star and tell all of my friends about this app if this problem was fixed. \n\nThank you for your time! ^^","227":"I love the app but I got 10 free coins for the anniversary thing and I used them but instead of shorting the time for the other episodes in the fast pass it kept it the same so now I have to wait like another 15 or so days before I can get the next episode. I think this needs to change cuz it\u2019s not fair for me or anyone to have to wait even longer than they should. I feel this is just a way to get money cuz ppl aren\u2019t gonna wanna wait like 2 weeks to read an episode after they did the fast pass. This should change because some of the readers are young and their parents won\u2019t let them spend money on games. Please change this. I would consider buying coins if this wasn\u2019t a thing but I don\u2019t wanna have to spend real money on something that I will go through in a day. Overall great app but a minor flaw.","228":"I love Webtoon. The stories are amazing and I love uploading my own story and how fast I got 50 views. It was nothing like posting on a usual social media where I get tops 25 views.\n\nHowever, I have a BIG issue with the publishing. I can\u2019t draw on a laptop and I don\u2019t have the funding for a drawing tablet and the equipment to hook it up to my laptop. I draw on my phone. Which is fine, but I have an iphone. The problem with this is I can\u2019t publish using the app or web browser. Sometimes, I can glitch my phone to get me the computer version of the website so that I can publish, but usually the glitch only works once every so often, which makes updating my new webtoon a hastle. Is there an easier way to do this? If there is, could somebody tell me? Or could there please be an update to either the website or app to make it easier?","229":"I am a long time user of Webtoon and have loved it for so long, I still have the iPad version of the app that has been discontinued in the app store but is still usable. I would like to implore that this newer app have better interface for iPad users as it is supposed to be for users of varying devices. The design of the iPad version was perfect and easy to use, it had; ability to flip orientation horizontally, bigger icons, a side bar to navigate search and different categories such as featured webtoons and those I had subscribed to, and a overall cleaner and more modern design. Another update that a huge portion of the audience would love is a dark theme option, especially anyone reading at night. Thank you for your consideration and hard work, with these improvements this will be an even more amazing app!","230":"I have WEBTOON ever since I saw the add. It is the best app I have on my phone! My problem with this is that I have to pay money to get coins to see the next episode. If it is already ready why not just publish the episode?! I am very picky about what to read so I almost never find something I like. I have 4 series that I am currently waiting for it to release. I know that is how apps make their money, but a Waiting a WEEK for something I can read in 1-4 minutes is just unreasonable. I hope all the authors are okay with the time period. I would appreciate the time period if I was drawing\/writing the comics, but as a reader I personally think it\u2019s a tad bit to long. I hope they can let the time shrink to about 3-5 days per episode. Sorry for the long review, it is my first time writing one and I have a lot of things to say about this app.","231":"Great app, love all the options, interface, basically everything about it. But the fact that completed series are not free to binge and reread is something that I\u2019m sad to see happen. Forcing readers to spend money and buy their coins in order to read a chapter of an old series just reeks of greed and monopolization of your creators products. In addition, we are only given 2 free passes to read these series, which are available for only 14 days. So after, when your free passes are used up, if u want to read it again, well, your out of luck unless you want to open your wallet. And while I\u2019m more than happy to support my favorite creators, I don\u2019t see how much of the money that I will spend on coins goes to the creators themselves. What a horrible implementation to try to milk users of money while promoting the app as a place where you can read \u2018free\u2019 webtoons, if you count 2 chapters as an entire series that is.","232":"I love this app. It is so much cleaner than the website and fits the episodes so much better. I enjoy being able to like the comments and laugh and cry with others at the wonder of these incredible stories. I really do enjoy this. My one addition is that I think it could add one thing to improve. It may be nice to be able to look at people as well as comics. Because I do like to see what my friends are reading and I would like to see what they commented on this particular WEBTOON I like. It is the one thing that I believe could be added to it. Otherwise enjoy it, read some good comics, and don\u2019t do fast pass kids, that stuff will get you hooked for life. The app has crashed maybe once or twice so I will be getting back to it, ahora.","233":"I use Webtoon pretty consistently: 1\/2 an hour up to 4 a day, and all I can say is I love it. Whether you're into comedy, romance, action, drama, or horror, there's something for everyone. The best part is its all free to read! They recently added in a new fast pass feature, which allows you to view updates earlier, but the thing about that is most Webtoons aren't even ready to update till right before the deadline, so it's an optional thing that most don't even have. Another great feature is the discover section where artist can upload their work for the world to see. I edit for one called you and me, and without the discover section, I'd never have the chance to edit for a Webtoon with over 1.3 million views! (Btw shameless plug, go check it out. Sedatecanopy is a superb artist)","234":"This app is amazing and I love it. I always look forward to reading the weekly updates to the webtoons I love. There are a large variety of stories so that everyone is bound to find at least a couple of webtoons that they love. Although the stories are only updated once a week, you can definitely tell each author puts all their effort and makes many sacrifices to put up new weekly updates that are very entertaining and enjoyable in a way that you never want to stop reading. Plus, I have so many webtoons on my reading list that everyday there is a new update that I can always come home to and read after a long day of schook and work. Overall, this app is very entertaining, enjoyable, and eye-grabbing. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone and everyone.","235":"I absolutely adore this app. I\u2019m a HUGE reader, I\u2019m constantly reading book after book and hardly get out enough to get more when I\u2019ve finished reading them. So this app is perfect for me when I\u2019m not currently reading any books. There\u2019s so many good comics that it\u2019s  hard to not have anything to read for the day.\nThe only thing I sort of dislike about this app; is that you can only subscribe to 100 comics and that\u2019s all. Surprisingly, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve found out because I seriously read that much. But I can easily unsubscribe to finished comics or ones that don\u2019t update anymore.\nOverall, this is hands down my favorite app. I highly recommend it to anyone out there looking for some good reads. And I do share it to as many people as I come across that like to read.","236":"It\u2019s Ruining the WEBTOON experience it\u2019s ruining the authors experiences to we should all be free to write and draw as we please no matter what it is it\u2019s unfair to the authors because of the policy authors are changing their writing style the way that they write is a part of them if someone were to say I can\u2019t write because this is like this then I\u2019d be going against my writing style and some authors are changing their writing style some people it takes him forever to figure out the writing style that the want to use and for them to just change the writing style that they chose just for some stupid policy I honestly think that stupid we should be able to write what we want and people decide to read it it\u2019s their choice they can easily click out of it they don\u2019t like it so I don\u2019t see why you need the stupid policy please change the policy so We don\u2019t have to change our writing style. Thank you And if you change it I will give you a higher review","237":"I know that the fastpass thing is kinda annoying.. but tbh there r no other legal apps that actually release all the chapters. If you start a WEBTOON on WEBTOON- most likely you\u2019d be able to finish it (it\u2019ll just take a while)\nBut when you read on like... LezhinComics, there\u2019s no guarantee that they\u2019ll release the chapters\/or even update the comics. \nBut WEBTOON gives you countdowns, and sometimes the authors will have an upload schedule that they post on their page.\nI\u2019m pretty sure that not a lot of people r gonna legit read WEBTOONs every single day\/every single hour of their lives. But reading on WEBTOON is definitely worth it \n(If you wanna binge- they have a \u201ccompleted\u201d category that usually has a lot of free episodes- and ofc everything is free in the canvas category on webtoon)","238":"first of all I absolutely love this app! I have been on for a little over 3 years and can even say I\u2019ve found the limit for how many you can subscribe too (200 if anyone\u2019s wondering).\nMy issue with the app happened after the most recent update. They made many, small, and new changes that I really dislike one being how now you can\u2019t see the number of the episode your reading and when you download episodes you can see the progress. I know these are very small details but they really pile up and make me miss the old updates. While I\u2019ve noticed most of the recent complaints about the app are about the fast passes and daily passes, if I\u2019m being honest it doesn\u2019t bother me because I understand it\u2019s too support the artists and I can just wait another week to read. But I still love the app and just the didn\u2019t make these small changes.","239":"My life has been very miserable since the introduction to the daily passes. I have absolutely no patience, so I love to read completed WEBTOONs in one day. But..... I can\u2019t because it has daily passes. Now I have to sit in the corner and suffer while my soul is saddened by the dark fate awaiting us... every day is a struggle I absolutely lovveee reading the stories but it makes me sad that I can\u2019t read what I want, when I want, however I want. It truly breaks my heart. I have been using this app for years and years I would really enjoy is if you get rid of the daily passes. I still have a few more things to say after I saw how many more webtoons are going to get free passes I need to say that not everyone has enough money just to pay when you just want to read something. Overall WEBTOON used to be a wonderful app I that I really enjoyed I know I already said this but please get rid out the daily pass system.\n\nP.s. WEBTOON is available anywhere anytime and ALWAYS FREE\nIt\u2019s becoming like all the other apps.","240":"I\u2019m a huge fan of this app!!! I love all of the amazing stories and the WEBTOON community, but I wish it was easier to get coins. Liked for example if you watch ads you might get a coin or two or everyday you can spin a wheel to earn coins. Not everyone can afford to buy coins and receive a full experience on this app. Maybe by adding functions to acquire coins easier, this app would be so much better!!!! One last thing. There could also be events where all the stories are unlocked for a period of time. Hopefully in the near future these ideas will be considered in the app! Thank you!!!\n\nAnother suggesting is having really popular WEBTOONZ or maybe all the original ones be adapted into their own anime. This would be an awesome feature and you could use ads to generate income!","241":"I have owned webtoon for a couple of years now and I love all of the comics on it. A couple of months ago, they started something called a fast pass. If you paid or used a certain amount of coins, you could read chapters early. I had no problems with this, because I could still read the chapters. Then, the daily pass came out. I was reading a lot of completed webtoons at the time that had decided to start using the daily pass. Not only did I lose my progress on where I was in some webtoons, I now have to wait so that I can get all the way back to the chapter I was on. Some of these webtoons, I was around two hundred chapters in. This is extremely frustrating for me. I get that the authors need to make money, but at least make it so that you don\u2019t have to restart the whole series. The only reason I am rating this at all is because I love these comics so much, and I would really hate to lose my motivation for reading them. \n- a person who really likes webtoons","242":"At first it was just a few recommended to me by a friend. But, slowly but surely, my experience grew into over 20 different comics that I could read everyday! What's great is that discovering them is easy too! With a list showing all of the good ones that being updated today, to looking at the best in each genre, it's very easy to browse and read. You can subscribe to your favorites, and even if you don't, WEBTOON keeps track of every single comic you've looked at. The rating and commenting system is par for the course in terms of quality, but having it at all is great! Thankfully, a majority of content is good for all ages! And the ones that aren't are very upfront about it, so you don't need to worry!\nAll in all, I love this app and will continue to use it for a long time to come!","243":"As starters, this app does great at its job and is a pretty good app for online comics. Earlier today, I ran into some problems. Recently I used my computer to read some webtoons on the browser version. I can\u2019t even access my coins there. And now I can\u2019t claim any free coins or use any of my current coins. This would all be fine if I could deregister the account on the computer. But I only get the option to deregister on my main device. So now, I can\u2019t use coins whatsoever. I understand that Webtoon wants to ensure that when it comes to coins, it\u2019s very protected, but the system still has a lot of problems. I would like to be able to use coins but since I logged on to my computer, one time, in the browser version where it doesn\u2019t even let you access the coins, I now cannot use coins on my account. I love the app but this issue is very annoying.","244":"Some of my favorite authors have not been able to post and share what they want to anymore and I don\u2019t find that to be fair. This new policy is too restricting for me to be okay with. I used to adore LINE WEBTOON because of how free and open it was to everyone but now it is putting restraints on how some authors want to make their stories. I recently read a post from one of my favorite authors saying that they had to last minute change their whole entire plot just because of this new policy. It makes me very sad to see how these amazing authors are having to stress in order to change their stories so that they fit this new policy. Instead of banning certain material wouldn\u2019t it be possible to put an age restriction on the stories that contain that content instead of taking it down? Someone worked very hard on all of that but now they aren\u2019t even allowed to share it and it makes me very very sad. Please reconsider the new policy.","245":"If I had done this review about a month or two ago, it would have gotten 5 stars. I love the different exposure we get to different artists and creators around the world! And it\u2019s so amazing that people have the freedom to post their stories without worrying about being crashed down. But with the new policy change, authors are being forced to change some of their mature stories or remove them completely since they don\u2019t follow this new policy. WEBTOON allows authors to add in warnings and such to make sure people understand the themes and age limits that are sensitive to some so people can choose to skip a story or a whole comic to avoid discomfort. But, either people still read and chose to report the creators or webtoon is really giving in to pressure from said people. It\u2019s not right that they are choosing to kick an entire group of people for the ignorance and discomfort of a handful. I really loved this, but now I\u2019m starting to have second thoughts.","246":"I absolutely love this app, but now it decided to add stupid daily fast pass stuff. I\u2019ve had this app for about a year and a half and used it almost everyday, but this update or new pass thing is just absurd. I can\u2019t go back and reread my favorite webtoon stories that are already finished anymore. Now I have to wait for a day before I can read ONE chapter or spend money if I want to read that chapter. And I\u2019m a broke high school student so I can\u2019t buy them and even if I had the money to do it, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it in the end. This is just very upsetting and heartbreaking as a person who has never really had a problem with the app before. Now I plan on taking my business else where to other websites to read instead of wasting my time on webtoon!!! Unless they decide to fix this problem I won\u2019t really be reading anything off their app anymore.","247":"So first things first I would totally give them a higher rating if it weren\u2019t for the fast Passes. At first I didn\u2019t mind them but now that they are taking completed series were before you could reread them as much as you like now you have to wait for a new episode to unlock or pay money to have them unlock this is especially frustrating as if you have read far into the series you know have to wait a long time for the episode previously to become unlock until finally you can even read one new episode. All I have to say is leave the completed series alone and focuses on putting fast passes on the newer series. That way people like me who have been long time fans on the app can enjoy reading the old series without all the frustrating bits. But overall I\u2019m glad that this app has gotten so big and only want the best for them.","248":"THIS APP IS THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME!!! Some of these stories make me cry, laugh, scream, and more!! They are sooooooo freaking good! AND YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO PAY MY DUDE!! I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better app! While you do have to wait a week until a new episode comes out, you can wait by reading your other favorites! I have like 10 different comics I\u2019m reading at the same time, and they all come out with new episodes on different days! It keeps me entertained, AND I can read them on a long boring car ride!! I\u2019ll even read them during school :0) but I seriously recommend this fantastic app. But if you don\u2019t believe a 13 year old that\u2019s fine I may exaggerate but I promise you, this app will make you OBSESSED. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\n\n-one weird 13 year old :3 UwU","249":"Good day, me and my sisters just admire this app very much. I\u2019m actually the first person to recommend this app to my siblings as I thought it was most appealing to me. Sometime passed and I enjoyed every second that I was able to read these very good plotted and original comics. But since each episode of a novel comes out at least once a week, I\u2019d like to would like to wait until the full comic was completed so I wouldn\u2019t have to wait desperately on a cliffhanger. Not long after that I was able to read the full comics without fret! Until a new update I presume showed up about a Daily Pass where I would have to wait more than I already had. This did not make me happy and I can\u2019t enjoy a \u201cCOMPLETED\u201d comic without being stopped. I prefer that the Daily Pass should be removed and should be restored back to how things were.","250":"WEBTOON is one of the best things to ever happen to my phone. I\u2019m a busy mom who also works and I love comics. I can read a short episode then get back to my daily routines and come back when I have another free minute. \nThey have all my favorite genres and I never run out of stuff I want to read! All the artists are phenomenal and the stories are engaging. I really love how this app continues to find ways to engage and improve the reading experience. \nWhen I run out of episodes, I find a new series to binge and it fills that comic void in my life. I own SO many classic handheld comics and manga, but many of mine are collectible and I can\u2019t just take them with me. WEBTOON is there at my fingertips any time I need my comic fix.\nThe WEBTOONs are fantastic. Do yourself a favor and explore it! You won\u2019t be sorry.","251":"I love WEBTOON, it really brings out the hidden nerd in me. WEBTOON has also helped me \u201cfind myself\u201d by discovering hidden feelings, or bottled up emotions; WEBTOON has been there for me. Even on boring car trips I can read a comic and feel relaxed. Or if I\u2019m going on a plane, I can just download comic episodes and enjoy them without internet connection. I love the art styles that the different artists put up; some of my highly favored comics that have made me cry, laugh, or even explode were \u201cmidnight poppyland\u201d, \u201cMurrz\u201d, and \u201cFreaking Romance\u201d. It just helps when I am overly stressed and want to watch someone else\u2019s drama. It\u2019s one of those apps where you would wish you were in their place and found love exactly like them. Or it could be that you wish to never be in that person\u2019s shoes.","252":"I\u2019m so upset bc even reading old made webtoon is hard with this new feature. Like u can only unlock two episodes every day unless u pay for coins. Even re-reading a series requires the same which is so unfair and just shows how greedy this app can be. I already deal with not being able to have fast pass on most webtoons so this added feature just makes everything worse. And who decided two episodes a day was fair in the first place???? If it\u2019s already released it should be allowed to be free, and if it\u2019s to pay the authors, they should be getting paid part of the commissions webtoon received form the ads placed at the end of each episode. Like this is a purely selfish feature that only forces ppl to spend even more money on this app. Daily pass should be taken down and I urge everyone to feel and right a similar review. I understand the importance of fast pass but daily pass is 100% unnecessary.","253":"I\u2019ve been reading Webtoon for at LEAST a year now. On iPhone, I have no issues. The app isn\u2019t glitchy, the setup is super easy to navigate through, and I can read my favorite comics everywhere. The reduction of a star is that I can\u2019t login to my account on my iPad. I made an account through my email, and nowhere on there does it say to sign in through email. Just Facebook, Line, and Twitter, I think. And the instructions that they provide you, if you did sign in through the three above methods, don\u2019t even work. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s been updated since the new revamp that came with IOS 11. (We\u2019re on 12.2 now). But overall, this app is awesome! The comics are great and there is an amazing fan base. So, if you haven\u2019t made an account, I would say that it would be definitely worth it if you did.","254":"I really love this app a lot!! It's free comics where you don't have to pay at all. You can also make your own comics and support others comics. You can comment on the comics. But there's this new policy that I honestly dislike. I like a lot romance and especially BL or Yaoi and sometimes there's parts where it gets heated and includes NSFW scenes or sex scenes. This new policy restrictions that from showing. I honestly hate it because sometimes those parts are important parts to the story. I understand that there are children that use the app but that's why a notification pops up asking if you are 18+. Because of this policy a lot of my favorite comics are discontinuing because of it. I'm sad to have a comic that I was enjoying stop updating because of this policy which is why I dislike it. I hope they can fix this problem.","255":"Just get the app. If you need something to read quickly, or are an avid reader, or maybe you don't even like to read, bit trust me you came across the right app. It's free. It has all genres. You don't need an account. And you can post your own work. Just download it. If you don't like it after you download it, no harm done, it's free. AND NO IN APP PURCHASES!!! Please get the app, you won't regret it. That new policy makes it safe for other younger readers as well so it can keep it's 9+ age rating and it's not like you came for porn anyways, if so go somewhere else you're unwanted (warning, this app has a comments feature, and can have you like and subscribe to stories so it's technically social media. It's also addicting to read on so be careful ;) you've been warned)","256":"I\u2019d give it 5 stars because I love the stories and don\u2019t really have a problem with anything else, but I have to give it 4 because my one exception for what I don\u2019t love about this app is for certain chapters of certain stories I have to watch an ad. Now I wouldn\u2019t care about that at all, I use a lot of free apps with significantly more ads, but the ads for WEBTOON never loads so I\u2019ve got a series or two I can no longer read. The worst part is the app tries to load an ad for all of a second (not exaggerating) before cancelling it automatically, so if I have slow internet or something (I don\u2019t think I do) or the app is overloaded (maybe), it doesn\u2019t give it anytime to complete the ad request. So, I never get to read the chapters. Thus, the app gets 4 stars instead of 5.","257":"I love this app. I love seeing all the different art styles and story plots. I love reading all the comics I love but because of the new policy, a few of my favorite webtoons might be ending. Webtoons is restricting the artists from what they like and want to draw. Part of the new policy involves 18+ stuff but there\u2019s lots of immature people reading it. If they don\u2019t like it, they can just unsubscribe and never read it again. Authors new to censor stuff for the public eye and post the nfsw scenes elsewhere so if people wanted to and could read the whole chapter without censorship they could. But completely getting rid of the 18+ stuff is kind of stupid in my opinion. It gets rid of parts of the story that could be a major part of the plot which causes lots of webtoons to end. I have a feeling that because of this policy, not just the 18+ part, lots of readers will delete the app. If you read to this point, thank you","258":"Okay so I read 95 chapters of a story which was very good and I was very invested. But also I never needed to get the fast passes I could just click through all those episodes, so I don\u2019t know if this was a glitch but of course i didn\u2019t mind it. Then finally it said to read chapter 96 to pay money or wait four days, my personal opinion I would forget about the app in four days and also forget about the storyline. I know that\u2019s how they make money but four days seems a little much. I also think since my app was messed up and I went through 95 chapters I was a little mad because I was so invested and now I deleted the app, but if I had gone through six chapters like other people maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so hard to turn away. Again great story but I wish I could read it without having to pay.","259":"Webtoon is a decent app. I like a lot of the comics on there, but dang the app itself is missing a lot.\nThere are some bugs. When you download episodes and read the downloaded ones, most of the time it duplicates every image. So for instance if there\u2019s an image for the title card, it would show that twice. This is super annoying. Another feature it could use it swiping. I wish we could swipe left and right to switch episodes instead of tapping the screen then tapping the arrow. There\u2019s a new glitch where when you read horizontally (which I always do, because my phone screen is small and I want to see the art) then you can\u2019t see the top menu of your iPhone (time, battery, service etc).\nOverall webtoon has a lot of good stories, but the app itself could use a lot of work and is worse than some other webcomic apps.","260":"I love webtoon and the stories are amazing! That being said I was absolutely ecstatic when webtoon introduced events where if you read certain number of episodes of certain stories by this date you will be able to redeem free coins to unlock episodes. Which does help these lesser known stories get more clicks and subscribers. But when I would complete these events then go to the page where I would redeem the coins ,it always would show a blank white screen. It happened in the past and it\u2019s happening right now with the thanksgiving event. In my head I\u2019m like \u201coh it\u2019s a bug\u201d but it really frustrates me when this would always happen when I am finished and done with the event. Reading 30 episodes of a webtoon you don\u2019t like only to get nothing? I just feel mugged of my time.","261":"I was in a horrible place in my life. It was REALLY bad. Then my friend was like \u201cHey you like comics. Check this out\u201d\n     I was silently screaming. But I felt alright whenever I realized my favorite artist got featured, and I\u2019d get giddy when a WEBTOON I read reached the top 5. \n     I know many people feel horrible and alone. Instead of feeling like the world is reaching out and trying to strangle you, try reading a comic, written and drawn by people who understand.\n     If you have anxiety, \u201cLet\u2019s Play\u201d will work. LGBTQ+ problems? \u201cAcception\u201d is full of them. Everything is there. Everything.\n     If you\u2019re having a hard time, please PLEASE read something. It\u2019s made me feel alive. If that doesn\u2019t work, there are always reading the comments, which are often even funnier than the webtoon.","262":"WEBTOON is the one thing I read at work when I am on lunch and I got a lot of my friend stuck on it but the new policy is making all the authors and writers delaying more and they are not updating recently only a little bit are clean versions but I will take a but toll out of them so I want the new policy to get canceled and the authors can do what they do the best. You guys need to change the policy it is making me spend money and I can\u2019t spend to much but I really like to give money to the authors and I can\u2019t give anymore because I am quoting my job this Monday and can\u2019t afford it anymore. And i love recommending this app to friends. So if you don\u2019t change the policy I will have to tell them to not download it or delete it because we love what the authors do.\ud83d\ude43","263":"I wasn\u2019t prompted to write a review, but I chose to anyways because of how ardently in love I am with the app. I\u2019ve always been a daydreamer type, and have fabricated many stories of my own in my head. To me, this application is a beautiful thing. It allows writers to have a nice space where they can share their own stories, and users can freely access them. It allows me to have a personal connection with the art and story without asking for me to pay for the next episode or wait a month to do so. I\u2019m overwhelmingly pleased with it. The writers are great people who strive to make content on a weekly basis, so if you have subscribed to lots of webtoons you\u2019ll always be satiated. Thank you Line Webtoon for letting writers share their talent and users to access such for free. :-)","264":"I love WEBTOON. I heard about WEBTOON because of my sister and I have been reading ever since. It\u2019s so great to read and chapters come out every week. (Some webtoons submit chapters more frequently)  It\u2019s not like a book where everything is already done. You get to follow the story, and comment on it. There are webtoons for discovering artists, and new webtoons come out a lot too. Webtoon is also FREE. There is just ads. (But like that\u2019s a small price to pay tbh) The art is also phenomenal! (I\u2019m looking at: Siren\u2019s Lament, My Dear Cold-Blooded King, Phantom Paradise, and so much more honestly.) The comics are easy to follow, and there are so many of them, it\u2019s hard to get bored. When I was looking for things to delete of my phone, webtoon was not one of them. Do yourself a favor and just download it already. Here are some good webtoons if you don\u2019t know what to start with: \n\nRecommendations: \nLong Binge Sessions: Tower of God, Noblesse, Space Boy\n\nMedium Binge Sessions: UnOrdinary, Phantom Paradise, MDCBK (mentioned earlier), Sirens Lament\n\nFast Binge Sessions: Adventures of God, Dustinteractive, Safely Endagered is good too, there\u2019s just a lot of episodes but they are short. \n\nDiscover Pick:\nSEED!!!!!!\n^^^read this^^^\n\nHappy Reading!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\nThanks for reading this review.","265":"WEBTOON is by far my favorite app to go on, and everything from the inspiring comics to the authors are amazing. But... what is happening to Fast Pass? I tried to buy the 50 + 2 coins for $4.99, because that is all I can get up to with my financial situation, but it would take forever to load. Then I tried to see if it did the same with the higher priced coins, but it didn\u2019t. This said to me that after a certain amount of times you buy a certain amount of coins, the app practically forces you to buy the more expensive options. Believe me, if I had that kind of money I would buy it, but like some others, my financial situations aren\u2019t the best. For that, I\u2019d rather wait for the episode to come out rather than be forced to pay an amount that is more than what I can afford.","266":"WEBTOON is an amazing app, it allows us to read Manhwa for free, giving people a chance to get into a few things. I sure enjoy Tower of God as some of the people who use this app for. The only concern I have is the amount of Manhwa we have, that and the quality of them. I do appreciate the WEBTOON team for allowing creators to come together, make a WEBTOON or even a company to do it. But. Not all share the same quality. This may not seem bad to a large company but when some of the product that you are selling isn\u2019t of good quality or advertises on something yet does not fulfill that, the consumer isn\u2019t happy. Which is why I am surprised WEBTOON has not tried to gain certain Manhwa such as Solo Leveling. That isn\u2019t to deter people from using the app, rather, a small warning as to ensure new reads don\u2019t expect to see all Manhwa here.","267":"I have been reading on line webtoon for a very long time and I personally love the app. The new update has ads on some chapters which I end up not being able to read because it always says that they were unable to load. This is not a major problem but I have noticed that it has effected people on the app. Often I read comments about people having similar issues or just complaining about it. I hope this doesn't make people dislike certain comics as I am not sure if only certain ones have ads or not. Not only this but I have seen may other people talk about problems with the app running (which I have) and the annoyance of the policies and other updates.I hope that either line webtoon can either fix the problems or change things back to the way they were before.","268":"When I first got web toon I deleted it cause I thought I would be something else, but I re downloaded it and now I\u2019m in love, there are so many good stories to read and it\u2019s just an amazing app over all.  It\u2019s been rlly helpful especially in quarantine. sometimes I get so attached to a story I even start crying at happy moments cause I\u2019m so happy, even when I re read them I still cry some of the stories this app has ate just... AMAZING like no joke I rlly recommend this app... but like all things there is also a bad I rlly love this app but the fact that some old\/finished stories have a 2 episode per day thing is rlly a turn off when I comes to this app, that is the reason I have to give this app 4 stars \u2b50\ufe0f but apart from that I love this app and don\u2019t have many more problems it\u2019s a great app over all love it \u2764\ufe0f","269":"One of the great things about it is that is has vast diversity, while most comic and story apps only have some genres Webtoon has anything you can think of! Also it\u2019s unique because it comes from real people sharing everything they can think of in their imagination all in one app, every time you go into a new story every part is packed with new and surprising twists and great plots that most other apps just can\u2019t compete with! Every time you go into a new story, it\u2019s like you open a whole new universe. All in the palms of your hand! That\u2019s my it\u2019s so amazing, try it out and see for yourself! I\u2019d strongly recommend this wonderful app because of its uniqueness, creativity, and setup that all comes together to make it such a wonderful app! Best. App. Ever!","270":"This app has transported me to so many worlds and I love it more than words can describe!!!! I also love that it\u2019s a place that accepts all sexualities and races!!!! My only two requests are that 1) I\u2019m notified when someone responds to my reply on their own comment. Like if I respond on someone\u2019s comment, they\u2019ll get notified that I responded but I won\u2019t know if they replied. 2) I\u2019ve actually made friends on WEBTOON, and I love talking to them via comments day after day!! But it\u2019s so hard to do that with the lack of notifications and bogging down an episode\u2019s comment section. I wish there was a way to chat with people and friend people. I know that there are many dangers of chatting online, but it\u2019s nice to talk to fellow readers about new updates and such.","271":"So i enjoy this app and the stories they have to offer but when i get into a story and read it the app does this thing where it stops me from going to the next chapter and says that a new device is detected and \u201cOnly 1 device can be linked to your Coins and unlocked content at a time.\u201d then it\u2019ll ask to switch to \u201cthis\u201d device, meaning the only device i ever read webtoons on. When you click ok it just takes you to the devices that you have linked (which is just the one) and forces you to either deregister the device and reregister it or you just gotta cancel. it\u2019s ridiculous because why does it even do that? if i reach a limit just say that i reached a limit, i\u2019m not even sure what the pop up means. very weird (possible) glitch.","272":"The app used to be free of all coins etc, and I understand they are trying to make profit out using the fast passes. But when they added the daily passes, there\u2019s no point of it. It just seemed like a quick money grab for older comics. (For example: Bastard\/Orange Marmalade) \n\nAdd Improvements:\nI think one way they can allow viewers to receive coins without paying or doing challenges would be advertisements. I understand the coins is a form of profit to them, but maybe a reader would be able to watch 3-5 ads for 5 coins. The only problems with the challenges is usually it\u2019s a lot of reader for very little coins. Such as the recent 100 tower challenge, which was 100 eps of reading in order to receive 5 coins. Those hours of reading would practically be equivalent to (maybe) 30 seconds of reading. I don\u2019t think that is quite fair.","273":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOONs for years already. I fell in love with the app because it provided a wide range of comics, with wide ranges of maturity. However, the new changes have made the app lose some of its spark. A lot of the artist I read have been affected and it\u2019s tragic to read their content go from being numerous pages to merely a handful with so much being lost due to the restrictions. And a lot of them are losing money they need to keep doing the thing they love, drawing. In all honesty, the app is just losing people to other ones like tapas. I have yet to download another app just because I\u2019m trying to remain supportive of my artists on WEBTOONs. It\u2019s been a decision that\u2019s effecting numerous types of comics in the app. I understand they don\u2019t want kids to see certain material but it\u2019s impossible to prevent kids from accessing such, regardless. I really hope something is done to resolve this.","274":"The app is well organized, keeps introducing me to new series to read and has become apart of my daily life to just relax. This new policy that they have enacted is...ruining my experience. It is targeting the NSFW (not safe for work) stories and forcing them to cover up those areas, although they already have an 18 and over warning. These artists put a lot of work into crafting these masterpieces and for them to be covered up is a shame. Now I\u2019m not saying that the characters shouldn\u2019t have a little censor sometimes, for example if they are nude, they would cover the privates with another object, and that\u2019s totally acceptable. What the new policy does, is make the artist put giant white boxes over the entire section, blocking out a good third of the page. Besides the new policy, the app is fine. If the policy could just get reversed everything would be PERFECT.","275":"Ok this is the first time I ever review an app but I feel like I need to. I have been using WEBTOON for 4 years now and I love it....that\u2019s until the new discover NSFW policy came. Honestly, I hate it. Why do you need to make it in the first place? I mean the authors censor everything so I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. They don\u2019t show the uncensored version so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s entirely NSFW. There\u2019s no benefit from making this policy and you will have many reader probably annoyed at this policy. There are many webtoon  reader who are mad at this policy and wish it to be removed, so I hope you can agree to our wishes and removed it. I honestly love webtoon because it\u2019s free and many people can post their stories on here freely (with NSFW part censor of course) and I hope it stayed that way. Sorry English isn\u2019t my first language so there may be many incorrect grammar, but I\u2019m sure you got my point! Please listen to our wishes and removed the policy!! Thanks","276":"Several months ago Webtoon started allowing autoplay ads in their content. They play with no warning and there is no way to turn off the autoplay in settings. Because the ads are video if some visits or reads Webtoons often it can start eating through a data plan fairly quickly.\n\nWhile I understand the ads are how Webtoons makes money, the fact is the autoplay ads are ruining this customer\u2019s experience. There should, at the very least, be an option to turn off the autoplay on these ads. I have already suggested this to Webtoons. They have not responded other than the standard auto-response confirming they received the suggestion. When two or three ads autoplay while you are trying to read through the latest update of a favorite comic, it becomes very frustrating. The last straw was while reading through My Giant Nerd Boyfriend and having the same ad play three different times. If you choose to download the app, good luck.","277":"I been reading for years and it\u2019s changed a lot recently and in a lot of good ways too! And the fast pass is a good thing too in a few ways like: you could read early, you support the author making the comic, and if the Author making the comic goes on a break you could still read even after a few weeks! But most people like I don\u2019t want to pay for early updates every time I feel like reading. Not to mention the webtoon team need to warm you about the fast pass, because for the 6th anniversary you get ten coins to read early (five per episode) and I used it on Room of Swords (my favorite comic) and now I\u2019m waiting three weeks for the next one!      It was so annoying because I\u2019m still waiting!","278":"A few years ago I would have rated this 5 stars but WEBTOON got money hungry. There\u2019s nothing wrong with paying to get an episode early for ongoing stories but the daily pass system is a joke. The best part of WEBTOON was rereading my completed favorites or binging recently completed stories so I wouldn\u2019t have to wait for new episodes. I could just read it all at once. Now you only get one episode a day and it expires after 2 weeks even if you purchase more passes. This is even on WEBTOONs with 300+ episodes that would take forever to finish. They claim it\u2019s to support the authors that finished their stories. If I want to support any other author though I\u2019d just BUY the whole book and then it\u2019s mine forever. I can read it whenever I want, not buy it again every 14 days. And this is on a site that proclaims itself to be FREE. If they really want my money I\u2019d gladly buy the whole series to reread again and again but the daily pass is stupid.","279":"I noticed someone else said it here, but I think it needs repeating bc it may be a glitch that just really needs to be fixed. App is amazing\u2014you don't pay for comics and the variety is just awesome\u2014can\u2019t get it almost anywhere else. Reason I knocked some stars down has to do with two things: 1. The glitch where when you read a couple slides of a comic then all of a sudden the app crashes. Literally one or two slides in and the app just gives up\u2014goes black and unable to function. 2. The fast pass\u2014I was actually thinking og getting into that but based on the amount of reviews detailing the issue that go as far back as Sept.... Ill pass. Its a huge disappointment but I\u2019m noticing when it comes to bugs the developers don\u2019t seem to be communicating their plans to resolve this. Until then I\u2019ll think I\u2019ll keep it as an ok app with 3 stars.","280":"So, I haven\u2019t seen this as a problem in any other reviews, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my phone or the app, but, I thought I\u2019d share it anyway. I love webtoon, however, lately, whenever I\u2019m reading, I\u2019ll maybe get through three, maybe more, before it completely freezes up on me, and I\u2019ll have to exit out, clear my history, and then go back in, but I usually have to do this three, four, sometimes even five times before, after a second or two, it goes back to normal, but then three episodes later, it\u2019s back at it again. It\u2019s never done this before, and my phone isn\u2019t that old, nor is is broken or something in anyway. Again, I\u2019m not sure why, I just thought I\u2019d mention it. Overall, great app, I\u2019d just like to be able to use it for more than five minutes or less at a time. :)","281":"This problem didn't occur until a few hours ago, because I was using it perfectly fine earlier today, but for some reason the app keepa crashing on launch now. I literally cannot access the app for anything, and it's the only app on my phone giving me a hard time. The funniest thing is, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and did all other sorts of measures thinking it was just my phone being all messed up, but when I opened the Webtoon app after all of that, it worked perfectly fine! That is, until I signed back into my account again. Then it kept crashing constantly again as it did before. What's wrong with my account that's causing my app to crash as soon as I open it? It's unusable, I can't do anything on it. Please fix this issue, because it's clearly not my phone. Webtoon is the only app with this problem and it only has this problem when I log into my account. Never had this problem before, why now?","282":"I\u2019ve been using this amazing app since it came out and I thought it was really cool and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone. The daily pass thing doesn\u2019t necessarily bug me too much because u get two free passes daily which is fine to me. However recently it started acting up, like today I was on it reading some good comics and then I stopped but then later when I tried to go back on it today it wouldn\u2019t even open up. At first I thought it was my phone so I tried turning it off and back on again but that didn\u2019t work so I deleted the app then re-downloaded it again but it\u2019s still not letting me into the app. So at this point I don\u2019t really know what to do. I have some really amazing comics on there that I\u2019d like to finish reading so if anyone knows how to help or has had this happen to them before any advice timeouts be great.","283":"I really want to give this app 5 stars but the bug issues are major! I\u2019ve had this app for a year or so and I love the content it has to offer. I was able to read for hours all of my favorite Webtoons with no problem. However, recently every time I am reading a comic, the app freezes, I can\u2019t scroll up or down, I can\u2019t go to the app home page\/use the back button, and now I can\u2019t even return to the iPhone home page because it will freeze my whole phone (I have an iPhone X, so no home button). There are times where I have to force restart my phone in order to close the app cause it just freezes my entire phone. This happens every time I use the app, so I am at the point where I can\u2019t use it period (even though I really want to do I can read and catch up on my favorite toons). I hope this issue is addressed soon because I love the Webtoons and want to read more from my favorite authors!","284":"I really like the app, I\u2019ve been using it for a few years now and one thing I wish is that the people who updates the app or whatever I hope they could be generous, I really hate how you have to buy coins like we ain\u2019t all rich, it would be so much better to have to watch a few ads to get coins like I get how they make us buy coins cause they need the money, but if you don\u2019t mind be so generous and have an update where we can watch ads for coins....technically your still making money and like totally recommend there be a time limit after watching a few ads and also don\u2019t totally get rid of the buy coins thing, there\u2019s probably people who would rather buy coins than watch an ad, but I don\u2019t mind if you give us a few more options (lol just ranted)","285":"I havent been on this app in a long time, But i came back to read something that i always wanted too \u201cHome, Sweet Home\u201d and when i came back i was reading up too ep 16 (the 17th chapter) when i was about to go to the next chapter it told me i need to buy the next few comics with coins. I dont know when this was added but what i do know is that this \u201cPay to read or wait until 22:00 (10:00 pm) to read\u201d and I was very upset with this discovery I would put off reading this for a few years because i was busy then forgot about this app. Now i am trying to read and it\u2019s telling me i have to pay for something that was free last time i was on Webtoon, Come on guys really? I understand you need to pay the artists and im not upset with that. I just think it would have been better to start the app like this instead of change it.","286":"I love WEBTOON, do not get me wrong. I found some of the most interesting stories on there that influenced me to write and draw. It\u2019s an amazing platform, with very high skilled features. But there is a recent update that is ruining the app, Daily Pass. Listen: I do not want to complain. But others are complaining as well. When a series I read is finished: it turns Daily Pass. Why is this bad? You can only read about 1 episode a day. Which is very idiotic of WEBTOON to add on. Just, what\u2019s the purpose of Daily Pass? I can\u2019t even reread my all-time favorite series without waiting weeks. When before the update I could just reread them, no big deal. WEBTOON, for the record your app is extremely amazing. I just advise taking off Daily Pass in the next update, it\u2019s making users of this app feel impatient when they just want to reread. Thanks, :).","287":"Webtoon is by far one of my favorite apps. I\u2019ve been on the app for years reading an endless amount of comics. I actually like the fast pass update I feel it give avid readers a way to give back to the creators but after the new update where older completed comics we now have to pay for I feel is unfair. I\u2019ve been on the app since when tangents meet and untouchable first came out and have re read them a multiple amount of times but now I have to pay to read it?! I just think that\u2019s absurd. And once these new featured stories are completed what\u2019s to say they make us pay to read the story again even if you used the fast pass. It\u2019s just disappointing to see my favorite app stoop so low to get more money from the consumer knowing full well their loyal fans and readers would pay the money to re read their favorite comics.","288":"I realize there are tons of free comics and that\u2019s so awesome. I also understand that artists deserve to be paid for their work, so I see the desire to charge us to read ahead with fast pass. It\u2019s pretty amazing there are no advertisements either. I just find purchasing coins to be tedious and it makes me feel guilty each time. Plus when you skip ahead once with fast pass, your basically stuck in the black hole of passing every time or waiting over a month for the next one. Plus many of the comic episodes are SUPER short and when you have a lot of comics you following you are spending a ton of coins! I think there should be an affordable monthly subscription option instead. I pay less for a month of Netflix at this point.","289":"Ok what is the deal with this \u201cDaily Pass\u201d thing I heard about? Apparently it costs \u201ccoins\u201d, and these \u201ccoins\u201d cost real money. Why? This is SUPPOSED to be an app to watch FREE comics, like it says. I was just getting into a Webtoon, Orange Marmalade, when the top comments are from 2015, and I can\u2019t read the next chapter. 2015! It\u2019s almost 2020!! And I can\u2019t go to the next episode, EVEN THOUGH it says it\u2019s finished! I read recent comments that say it\u2019s a \u201cdaily pass\u201d thing and you have to \u201cwait 14 days before you can read the next episode\u201d. Come on! If you\u2019re that desperate for money, please, find some OTHER WAY. The fast pass was okay for me, I mean, I don\u2019t love it but how about you keep doing that, and find another way, like ads? I would much rather have an ad every 1 or 2 episodes than some dumb \u201cDAILY PASS\u201d. It\u2019s better than having to pay for the chapters, but still. Please take the daily pass AWAY! Why do I even have to write a review for this?","290":"Hi! I\u2019m gonna try and make this quick and simple so I\u2019ll just get straight to the point. I\u2019m currently reading a WEBTOON titled \u201cLove Lesson\u201d, and I have to watch an ad to read the episode. To be honest, I have absolutely no problem watching ads to read episodes! As long as I get to actually read it I\u2019m completely content. But when I tried to click on the episode to watch the ad, it said \u201cUnable to load Reward ad. Please try again later.\u201d I tried again a few hours later, still couldn\u2019t watch the ad to read. Now there\u2019s 3 new episodes out that I can\u2019t read because I can\u2019t watch the ad. Please, Please, Please fix this! I\u2019ve been binge reading this series and it\u2019s driving me insane that I can\u2019t read the new episodes!","291":"So, I have been pretty upset with the new policy. Authors cannot produce their work and show the amazing skill that they want to welcome us into! And it\u2019s not like, \u201cWe have to take it off, some people are too young,\u201d well, books do come with MATURE WARNING. So you can\u2019t go to a book and say, \u201cNo more NSFW.\u201d Well, THEY DID WARN US!\n\n Because of the new policy, the chapters and episodes of some of my lost favorite books are shorter than regular. And the new policy is just something making it worse. And I understand that you are your own company, but we have our own opinion. And I\u2019m trying to give structural criticism. And I think that this is a dumb new policy, sorry not sorry.\n\n Even if they censor it, it can\u2019t be published?! That\u2019s just dumb. I\u2019m sorry, but I think that this app is just getting lower and lower. To the point where I want to delete it, but the app has my favorite authors and comics, that\u2019s what\u2019s holding me back. But now I can\u2019t enjoy myself because the chapters are getting blocked. Thank you.","292":"this app is AMAZING I was getting bored with Crunchyroll cause they had SO MANY ADDS but WEBTOON NEVER GIVES ME ADD PROBLEMS there are never adds covering my screen or blocking my view or anything I have to sit through and the comics are AMAZING the featured ones update weekly and there\u2019s other sections with probably thousands of comics I log on every single day to see the comic updates. It\u2019s how I keep track of the day of the week. I have a subscribe list with like 50 comics on it. Oh and the app has a link to a thing called patreon that lets you follow and support and donate to THE BEST AUTHORS EVER oh but WEBTOON itself is totally free also the comments section is totally crazy and most of the authors actually read your input I literally am ending the review here cause they just updated. But install it it\u2019s great.","293":"Let me get to the point. \nDaily Pass: Besides the fact that everyone\u2019s mad at the whole daily pass thing, I understand y\u2019all need money. My problem is that we can only read ONE comic a day?! At least let us read 5 a day. Give us some room to work with please because not many of us are willing to pay just to read one comic in a COMPLETED series. \nFast Pass: I got my first fast pass comic. I waited for a week to read the next comic only to find out that I have to wait another week. You should change it so that if we bought a fast pass for a comic, we only have to wait one more week for the next one instead of two (when it normally comes out). It was really annoying and I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll ever buy again if it\u2019s like that.","294":"Webtoon is a great app! The story\u2019s are so well done, And thought out, the authors really take there time on the episodes. One story I really love is SubZero (can\u2019t remember the authors name right now)But theres something called a free pass, It lets you see episodes quicker. I think it would what the Wedtoon experience even more wonder if they could make daily rewards, to win coins. Similar to how chapters or episodes does. \n\n(More about the coins\/Freepass)\n\nThe freepass is not like a fortnite battlepass because I\u2019m fortnite that\u2019s a one time purchase but in wedtoon every fast pass episode they will always be 5 coins to spend, I think it\u2019s called a free pass. For the story I love (Subzero) there are currently 3 episodes on the on the fast pass. One is available in 4 days another in 11, and the other in like 23 days. To buy one episode it is 5 coins. So in all that would be 15 coins if you purchased all episodes. So for people that don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t spend money on special passes I think there should be daily rewards, and that\u2019s on period.\n\nBUUUUUT if your looking for a good drama if you ever download wedtoon subzero is def a good starter and there all hotties \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\n\nSo I hope this can be taken into consideration, Thank you.","295":"This app is so amazing, and it\u2019s basically my getaway from the real world with all of the creativity that people have in the app. The one issue I\u2019m having is an unknown device accessed my Webtoon account, now I can\u2019t deregister it to use Coins\/Fast Past. This issue isn\u2019t really the app itself, but a hacker. I just really wish I could use Fast Pass with Coins, but the device that took over the register won\u2019t let me change it back to the device I\u2019m using. Nothing is different about my Webtoons, whoever or whatever isn\u2019t even doing anything on it. Aside from my impatience to read episodes with Fast Pass from Coin events instead of waiting, this is an amazing app.","296":"I have been using this app for years, and the stories are amazing! The best I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s free and also a great way for artists to be discovered. The fast pass is a great idea, I believe, to help support the artists\/authors for their story, but the daily pass of already overkill. Why not just add a Buy Me A Coffee option? This limits how much someone could read and makes the idea of this app being free seem like a scam. I shouldn\u2019t have to pay to reread a story if I already paid for fast passes before it was completed. Also, I noticed that some Originals aren\u2019t completely translated, like missing parts or marked as compete when their Korean counterpart has more chapters. \nOverall: get rid of the daily pass, I\u2019m not paying for that. And make sure everything is included in the story. That would give it 5 stars","297":"Hey. I swear. This app is amazing. Download webtoon. You will be welcomed into an AMAZING COMMUNITY of cosplay, art, stories, fandom, and SO MUCH MORE. I have cried my eyes out, laughed until my stomach hurt, and pulled multiple all-nighters bingeing these comics. You WONT be disappointed. Here are some stories to get you started:  \u201cLumine\u201d pleases everyone- it\u2019s heartwarming and heartbreaking and beautiful. \u201cSubzero\u201d is pretty sexy ngl. \u201cGourmet Hound\u201d is DELICIOUS and just AMAZING. So many beautiful people. Hold on.. let me check my list.... OH!!! \u201cCastle Swimmer\u201d is SOOO AWESOME!!! It\u2019s BL, which has a lot of stories in its genre- \u201cNot Even Bones\u201d is an AMAZING THRILLER that includes some violence. If you like that, \u201cI am the Grim Reaper\u201d is really cool too.  Oh, and I personally haven\u2019t read it, but \u201cLore Olympus\u201d has some amazing reviews too. If you\u2019re a Greek mythology nerd. omg just GET IT","298":"I honestly love webtoon a bunch and I\u2019d really love to be a creator not to get money from the ads but mainly because I wanna put out my story out there before I do something big but there\u2019s one problem.. my computer is old and has like no space my solution do it on phone but guess what, y\u2019all only do it on desktop I\u2019m not trying to be rude or anything because this is the app I probably go on the most but I would really like to see if you\u2019d pretty please add the feature to iOS or just phones in general but I think there would be more creators coming out if you added this feature to phones or other stuff (Dunno if it\u2019s only phoned that don\u2019t have it) I really hope you do add this feature though TvT","299":"I tried this app a couple years ago and it was the biggest piece of crap Id ever seen and quite frankly was amazed they\u2019d have the balls to advertise it on their site, but I tried it again today and it\u2019s what Id originally hoped for. It\u2019s a great app now and I\u2019m enjoying it. \n\nMy only thing keeping me form giving it 5 stars though is a big one. It wont rotate for iPad. I keep my iPad mounted with a keyboard cover, so when its mounted it is sideways instead of upright, but WEBTOON wont rotate with the iPad angle so everything appears sideways unfortunately. This severely limits my time for reading for when I dont have it mounted with the keyboard which is most of the day. I work on the ipad a lot and type on it a lot, and like to take occasional breaks and read a webtoon, but for now I\u2019m gonna have to stick to the website since Id have to read sideways with the ipad app.","300":"I love this app. It\u2019s great for readers and artist\/authors alike. Everyone can share their creativity and love for stories and art and it\u2019s truly wonderful to be able to read, discover, and create. \n\nMy only issue is the recent policy, which no longer allows comics with certain mature themes to be allowed. I really wish there could be a mature only section allowed (if it could be separated like a genre is in the app), or if webtoon started a different type app more so suited for stories with mature themes. Often timed stories are flagged for nudity or mature themes even when authors warn their audiences or sensor them, and I\u2019ve had many of favorite stories of mine removed or authors\/artist stopped using webtoon for that reason. A lot of them have moved to tapastic to be honest.\n\nI get that there are people who are sensitive, and\/or underage. Many times even if you have a pop up asking to confirm their age they lie, state this in the comments section, and then are disturbed and report it even though they lied about their age. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the authors to get flagged by readers for themes if the proper warnings are placed on them. \n\nI do still like the app, I just wish there were more available to the mature themed comics.","301":"This app is amazing, I love it to death, all of the individual creators on here deserve so much love, the artwork is diverse so there\u2019s something for everyone, I really recommend this app to anyone and everyone.\n\nOne thing I just wanted to put here, hoping someone sees it, is that lately the app has been a bit buggy, doesn\u2019t update when it\u2019s supposed to, sometimes for days. Might be a phone thing, idk, if it\u2019s the app, I hope someone might check it out because I love webtoons and eagerly await every night when I can read the updates, but am really disappointed when it doesn\u2019t update. And I\u2019m not talking about like a couple minutes or hours, I\u2019m saying like it takes a day or two to update to where it\u2019s supposed to.","302":"I love WEBTOON but this new policy has seriously made me mad. All the creators I love are saying that they are thinking of stopping their comic because of the new policy. I don\u2019t like how mature content is not allowed because some people didn\u2019t like it. You shouldn\u2019t ruin the app for everyone because of these few people. This new policy is not just affecting the viewers it\u2019s also affecting the creators. You are destroying there hard work. Basically you are telling them that the countless hours that they put into these comics are unappreciated. Most of these creators are up all day and night trying to perfect their comic for the viewers. And most of the time in the middle of the mature scenes someone will say something important, aka something that will be mentioned later. But as soon as that time comes we won\u2019t understand what they mean. All I am saying is that a lot of people don\u2019t like the new policy, we all have a reason and a lot of people will make their reason clear.","303":"I absolutely love this app. I enjoy reading people\u2019s works and I\u2019m obsessed with so many of these stories. I\u2019ve had so many emotional rides. I would rate this a 5 but I really hate when completed webtoons have a daily pass. I just want to read the full webtoon. It\u2019s super annoying to just want to read amazing stories and support these authors but I can\u2019t I want to read the stories they are seem so amazing, but I\u2019m not patient enough to know that the story is complete and I can\u2019t just speed read it. Overall I really enjoy this app. Just I would get rid of the daily pass. So plz webtoon hear our pleas and get rid of the daily pass. Also I\u2019ve been reading some of the other reviews I think of webtoon would get rid of the daily pass you would probably get a better review.","304":"I read webtoons for at least 4 hours a day and I find some that are amazing, like the new one that came out today, \u201cMy daughter is a zombie\u201d and so fourth. But I can\u2019t read them since they have the daily pass. My family isn\u2019t doing so well financially so I can\u2019t read them, I also know that the authors need money and stuff but this is just ridiculous. So many people already pay for coins for fast pass, but now daily pass? I just wanna read webtoon, I\u2019m sorry for complaining but I think almost everyone is with me on this. It\u2019s annoying. We wanna read but then we are hit with daily pass? We already have to wait for the fast pass, why do we have to wait for the daily pass?!?! Please webtoon, hear us, and take it down. Thank you.","305":"Ok, so I love webtoons so much because the stories are amazing. But, one issue is that when an event happens for coins, the app only gives you 3 coins when you need 5 coins to unlock an episode. My coins usually expire by the time I get another 3 coins, so I never get to use ANY coins. Another annoying thing is that I have to wait a specific time before I can read the next episode of something. For example, I am reading a webtoon and it says I have to wait seven days for the next espisode. I wait seven days and then the day I\u2019m allowed to read it, it says episode free in 10 hours. So, I have to wait until the end of the day to read it. But if your thinking about getting webtoons you totally should because the stories are great. That is what I think.","306":"Just to start off, I would like to mention that I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for forever. I recently started getting back into it. Today I had off and had nothing planned so I logged on and started reading \u2018Girls of the Wild\u2019s\u2019 which I\u2019ve become obsessed with. I got to episode 124 when I wanted to log off for a quick second because the first image wasn\u2019t loading in and it was kind of lagging. However, when I went to enter the episode again, it said I had to pay for it to remain free, which is just bogus because I\u2019ve been binge reading this all day and all of a sudden I have to pay for it, when I\u2019ve already read part of the episode. When I went to go read other story\u2019s it had done the same thing. If webtoon is going to make me pay to continue reading a story like \u2018Sarah Scribbles\u2019 and pay money just so it remains \u2018free for 14 days\u2019 nooooo thank you. I\u2019m sorry for ranting but this just ticked me off...","307":"i LOVE webtoons (i\u2019ve had this app for 2 years now) but the coin this is annoying. i have to wait 5 days to read my favorite comic for free?! tbh it\u2019s just ridiculous. sure i understand the app is getting big now but putting coins on episodes are stupid. i\u2019m actually beyond angry coming back to this app seeing i need coins to continue reading this app. apart from the coin situation, when i sign back into my account on other devices, my other comics i subscribe to lose it\u2019s place on the last episode i read (so i end up pressing random episodes until i realize which one i left off on.). trust me i would give this app a 5 star rating but the coins problem & signing in into my account losing my place in my comics is a major 3 star rating. hope you take the coin situation into consideration & problem with signing in, losing all comics places.","308":"I absolutely love WEBTOON; It\u2019s probably my favorite app. I can\u2019t imagine my life without it. The comics are everything and I love them. As much as I love WEBTOON, there is one issue that NEEDS to be fixed ASAP. And I know most people will agree with me when I say that I ABSOLUTELY HATE DAILY PASS AND IT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY. I know you want to help the creators still make money, but this is absolutely ridiculous! There are a lot of interesting stories in the completed section that I really want to read, but unfortunately, I\u2019m not even going to TRY reading. I am not going to wait a FULL day to get an episode. Don\u2019t I have to wait enough for all my other unfinished WEBTOONs? Until you fix this, my review is four stars and it will never go up, and I mean never, until this issue is fixed. Thank you.","309":"i\u2019ve already signed up for webtoon  with my email and password a while back, but recently i wanted to sign back in to catch up on the latest comics and finishing reading the \u201cSave me.\u201d comic. i haven\u2019t been able to sign in because it says that my email address hasn\u2019t been registered. so i decided to sign up again instead :) . when i tried signing up with my email, it told me that i could not sign up because that email has already been registered..? i\u2019ve repeated these actions and it just says the same thing over and over again :| . i really want to get back on my web toon account and finish my comics, but sadly i cannot until this matter gets fixed. i would\u2019ve rated this app five stars, but i can\u2019t do that until i can log back in to my account.","310":"This app is my favorite comic app by far. I like how consistent the updates tend to be and how easy the app is to navigate. \n\nOne of my favorite parts is that there are more types of comics besides romance. (Most apps tend to have basically the same romance stories). I love that canvas allows artists to share their ideas even though they don\u2019t get paid.\n\nThis is my only complaint: I had previously read some completed series and absolutely loved them, later I wanted to reread them and Daily Pass was added. Unless I wanted to pay I had to wait everyday for the next episode. I understand that these authors need to make money, but I wish that since I had already read the series I wouldn\u2019t still have to wait.","311":"I used to have this app and let me tell you.. amazing. I saw it on a TikTok add and I knew I just had to have it. If I was ever bored or just didn\u2019t know what to do in the backseat of a car I just opened up Webtoon and scanned for comics. Sure, the fast pass is a pain but the comics are SO worth it. I\u2019d recommend the Room of Swords; a story about an adorable kid looking for his ship or is it really a search for swords that lead to something bigger? This story is good for sci-fi geeks and people who just love action, romance, and the thrill all in one. Now I can\u2019t just tell you every. SINGLE. ONE. Of the comics I\u2019ve read but here are some really good ones; Mage and Demon Queen, Safely Endangered, Again the Room of swords, Blue Chair, and Mango. Anyway, Have fun with the app if you do get it!!","312":"Webtoon in general is a great place, I can read a lot of stories from a lot of different authors and I clearly enjoy it, but the new policy kind of put me off, considering that it causes authors to remove episodes or pages because of NSFW content is kind of whack, there\u2019s a warning at some stories that there is a mature content and if there\u2019s a mature content you shouldn\u2019t read it if you\u2019re not OK with it and honestly the policy is kind of bogus. I personally believe that stories or episodes or anything like that should never be completely taken down for content like that, there should just be a mandatory warning on every story that has mature content that says \u201cthe story as mature content please do not read if you\u2019re not comfortable with that\u201d because there is no reasonable point for removing all those things for the people that actually enjoy it.","313":"Ok first that I have to say is that I love WEBTOON. I normally hate reading but WEBTOON got me into a hole where I\u2019m reading everyday. I\u2019m always looking forward for each comic that comes up. Something I do have to say is that why this new rule of the Discovery Policy? This will ruin a bunch of story lines for the writers. I\u2019m very disappointed with this because I love BL (Boy Love) and some of the story\u2019s contain NSFW or need to contain it for the story. Isn\u2019t WEBTOON for the writers to express their ideas and for the readers read what they like. Then for the readers that like BL like me this will ruin everything so what I\u2019m asking if you can at least get it to be where there can be NSFW but still have a rule?\n~From your fellow BL lover and many more\n\n(Found out because of EYES ON ME\n<~its a good BL! And the ship needs to happen with NSFW that\u2019s how the writer wanted it (and some readers) please fix it at least)","314":"I love WEBTOON and it\u2019s content but there are way too many inappropriate comments in the webcomics I\u2019ve read. There are a lot of links going to porn websites and bots saying inappropriate things in comics for 12 year-olds, please either change the age rating of this app or make it to where bots can\u2019t get on somehow and make it to where people can\u2019t send links through WEBTOON because like I said porn websites. Also I just wanted to say this it\u2019s not related to inappropriate comments but the limited 2 episodes of completed comics is annoying as hell so please get rid of that. Ok bye I love WEBTOON and all the comics so I\u2019ll still give this a 5star rating, not ur fault about what people comment so I shouldn't down vote the app just because of that.","315":"I am a huge fan of the webtoon community, and I think WEBTOON is a great app! I do have a few complaints though, such as the fast pass. When you use the fast pass, you have to wait extra long to read the next episode. I think it\u2019d be nice if the next episode also came for free next week, without me having to wait two weeks for the episode that was supposed to come out then. Also, the daily pass, I think it\u2019s a good feature, it allows creators to make profit off their old works, but maybe instead of the episode you use a daily pass on only being free for 14 days, maybe you could extend that time period to a month? Overall, great app, super easy for navigate, awesome.","316":"I normally don\u2019t leave reviews, unless there is huge issue. As of the last update, I have a huge issue.\nThe app is no longer operable; I tap on comics and either nothing happens or it takes me to a blank screen. I try to swipe or tap, and the app doesn\u2019t respond half the time. I attempted to clear cache, but not even that would respond. I deleted and reinstalled the app. Nothing changed. Still broken.\nNow, if this was just an update thing, I would just email them, but I\u2019ve been using this app for a few years and it\u2019s feels like the app has gotten slower and problematic as time went on. \nI really hope the next update will fix the issue. I love the writers and artists that put out such great work. I would hate to miss out on the stories I\u2019ve been following for the last few years. They deserve 5 stars, but I give 1 star to the functionality of the latest version.","317":"I\u2019ve had this app for a little while now, and it\u2019s great to be able to enjoy other people\u2019s creations and also be able to support them with the Fast Pass option. My teenage cousins like to use the app, as well, when I\u2019m babysitting them. The only problem I have is when reporting inappropriate language. My cousin had made a comment on one of the comics that had been using fake artwork and was called names that no 14 year old should be reading. I had reported these comments months ago and nothing has yet to be done and the person continues to comment these nasty words (I get emails every time they make another comment, which is annoying) I\u2019ve had to tell my cousins the can no longer use the app. Please follow up more on these reports, because kids shouldn\u2019t be subjected to such horrible language.","318":"So I know other apps where you can click filters. Gendered you wants and and ones you don\u2019t want. All we have right now is a few genres and you can only view one at a time. Like, romance; drama, ect. But it would be nicer if it was +romance + drama so comics that are both would come up. Also, not all comics come up... only like the top 20. I kinda find it hard to find new comics without having to really search... and I have to REALLY REALLY REALLY search if there\u2019s a specific genre I want. I think it would just make it easier if there was something like this. (LGBTQ filter would be nice.) it would also make it easier to find newer less popular comics. (Not sure if filter is the right word to use... hope it makes sense) I love the app tho but if something similar like this was added I think the app would be easier to use.","319":"I\u2019ve had webtoon downloaded for years and loved it ever since. One thing that attracted me the most was how free and accessible it was. I though fast passes were a great way for people to support creators through coins. But, ever since daily passes have arrived I\u2019ve lost access to most of my favorite classic webcomics. If I were to get chapters back, I\u2019d either pay for every single episode, or have to wait months to reread for some series. Having to wait once again is extremely annoying, and makes the idea of using pirating sites a lot more appealing. It also stops me from rereading, and discourages me from recommending multiple series to friends who like to binge read. I hope webtoon takes away daily passes in the future, because I\u2019d love to reread lots of different series without the hassle. The app was much more appealing before daily passes.","320":"I have enjoyed this app thoroughly, the amount of comics to choose from is excellent. I have been on Webtoon for months now and I can say definitely say it has it\u2019s problems as well, but do not let this discourage you from the app. The first problem is that once you delete the app and download it again, all of you subscribed and history is gone, not even a single comment you\u2019ve made comes up in your history. When you enter the app you be exposed to the same walkthrough when you first got the app. Very frustrating. Another problem is that all of the very popular comics are shown most of the time, that is why I find it difficult to find webtoons that aren\u2019t as attention grabbing. Those are my thoughts and to be honest, The first point I made really shocked me.","321":"I just wanna say that I never write reviews for apps but I felt the need to write one for this app. I\u2019m in love with it. It\u2019s got beautiful stories in a whole bunch of genres and amazing artwork to go with the stories. If you enjoy reading but maybe don\u2019t have time for books or just prefer shorter stories this is for you. I LOVE horror and thrillers and this app lets me read stories from multiple very talented authors in those genres. And then after I\u2019ve sufficiently  scared myself I can hop over to the comedy genre to help myself sleep. The only thing I don\u2019t like is having to wait for the next episodes because the stories really build in suspense, but honestly that\u2019s a good thing because I\u2019m super hooked! 15\/10 recommend","322":"This app is amazing! Highly recommend this app. It worked basically flawlessly until they started updates a bit earlier in the day,  or after fast passes were added. This little bug is very minor but wanted to address it so it may get fixed im the future. So, all the featured WEBTOONS are \u201cUp\u201d and I go to read them. Basically Every time it doesnt show a new episode immediately, I need to press the arrow on \u201cFast Pass\u201d episodes, then unclick it, then it is there. This only happens with the webtoons with the fast pass feature.  VERY  minimal, takes me less than 2 seconds, at first it was very confusing to me. I dont know if anyone else has this problem? Hope it can fixed, this app is absolutely amazing.","323":"Just to preface, I love webtoon. I use it frequently to read in my spare time and I\u2019m always excited for new uploads. That being said, there\u2019s this bug that has been bothering me. I can\u2019t really say if this is just for Original series or both Original and Canvas as I really don\u2019t keep track of it, however I was reading an Orginal series not too long ago, and when I had gotten near the bottom of the episode, a black screen pulled up and then the app crashed. It happened twice on the same episode and twice on the one before it, always near the end. I usually don\u2019t like making bad reviews, but it\u2019s gotten so bothersome at this point. I\u2019m not even sure if other\u2019s are facing this problem, but if there is, then I\u2019d like for someone at the company to see this.","324":"With all the ads that I\u2019ve been seeing, I was really tempted to download this app. And when I did I started to read this story, but when I got really deep in it, it just said that I needed 5 more coins. I was like, \u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d At first I thought that I finally found a good app that didn\u2019t involve coins or tickets so I could continue reading. But I really don\u2019t see the point in using coins or waiting days just to read another episode. But overall this is a great app! I know you probably won\u2019t read this or even consider it, but I wish that I could just continue reading without using coins, everyone would probably like that too. You might even get more downloads and better reviews too. Well that\u2019s all, just please take away the coins, thx! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99","325":"I am fairly new to Webtoons but I agree that the daily pass for old\/ completed comics leaves a bad taste. It feels like a money grab and spoils what is otherwise a joyous experience in discovering artists and their stories. I do love to read new Webtoons, but there is nothing like the satisfaction of reading one from beginning to end without unnecessary pauses. I think the daily pass is shortsighted because it causes readers feel like they are being taken advantage of, which turns them off to spend any time or money on the app, and in the end, the artists are the ones who lose. I would definitely change my review to 5 stars if the daily pass was removed because it is otherwise an amazing app.","326":"I\u2019m really not sure what\u2019s going on, but for the past few weeks(I think), the app hasn\u2019t been working. It\u2019s taking forever to load onto the home screen and even then, the whole thing doesn\u2019t load. When I pick on a story, it loads in everything but the actual chapters, so I\u2019m unable to read anymore. I assumed it was an issue with my Wi-Fi, but every other app was doing fine, so I checked off that. I tried to redownload the app, but the same issue still arose. Again, I now assumed it was my phone that was the issue, so I downloaded the app on a relatives phone but the same issue happened on theirs too. Webtoon works fine on the web, I just prefer to use the app for a better experience. Please help!","327":"I LOVE webtoon it's giving me a reason to wake up in the morning early just so I can read all my webtoons that updated that day.

However, this new policy regarding NSFW content has really taken a negative toll on my like towards webtoon. Authors work extremely hard to make content and for their stories to be taken down just because you guys couldn\u2019t come up with a better way to censor nsfw content is ridiculous. This is making webtoon less of a free platform with these restrictions put in place. I\u2019m afraid that many authors including some of my favorites will look and move to other platforms which maybe not be free and are lower quality at the  expensive of not having to adhere to certain restrictions. Please find another way to filter nsfw content so that it doesn\u2019t affect authors and their hard work.\n\nI\u2019ve had my favorite authors leave webtoon because of this or others post \u201cIncase this gets taken down\u201d. That\u2019s just sad, tampering down on these individuals creativity to release their content.","329":"This app is great. I\u2019m a creator on Discover, but with the new update it kind of kills the \u201cchallenge\u201d. \nAll of the popular webtoons are moved to the \u201csort by most popular\u201d section. Sure, that\u2019s great, but what about the new ones? \nThey have to manually click to see the \u201csort by date\u201d option and by then they\u2019re probably already tired from binge reading the popular webtoons. Most of the time, they won\u2019t even click \u201csort by date\u201d at all. The popular webtoons on Discover got there through the old system, where your webtoon would be moved to the top of it updated. Now, they\u2019re at the top of everything. I like the new neat interface, but please don\u2019t limit our only method of advertising our comic. Thank you.","330":"This app is amazing. I\u2019ve had this app on and off for about 2-3 years, and I love it. As a learning artist, it is very inspiring. The art in a majority of the comics is gorgeous, and the stories are great. The only slight issue a lot of people have with it is the \u201cDaily Pass\u201d on completed Webtoons. I\u2019ve always enjoyed going back and re-reading old comics I liked, but the Daily Pass makes it so you can only read 1-2 episodes a day for free, and you have to pay with coins in order to read more. I understand it\u2019s beneficial for the artists, which is why I gave 5 stars. I hope the creators can perhaps consider making it so we can read a little more episodes a day for free. Other than that, I\u2019m loving this!","331":"I adore this app, the main reasons being that you don\u2019t have to spend money at all if you don\u2019t want to. They host contests were you can win coins which can be used to read episodes of comic that haven\u2019t been published yet.  They have so many great stories, and lots to choose from. In my experience most comic apps lock lots of comics behind VIP passes that use money. One of the other apps I used for comics recently switched over to fully VIP passes which cost money, so now all my comics are locked. Plus unlike most apps if theirs 50 episodes published you can read up to those 50 episodes instead of where other apps  you would still have to wait to get them free.","332":"The user experience is really well-designed! \n\nIf I could suggest any changes, it would be to add a feature that allows readers to filter out spoilers in the comments. Perhaps a spoiler alert before clicking on a specific comment, or even a separate comment section for first-time readers and for re-readers??\n\nSpecifically in the webtoon Tower of God, the comment section is essentially just a war between first-time readers who want to read and talk about the story from a pure perspective, and re-readers who want to talk about new insights and spoilers with other re-readers. I feel like there should be spaces for both types of audiences to interact with each other without having the story ruined!!","333":"This is the best app I have ever used very little complaints about the content I only want to see the app grow!! \n\nFirst off this app is 100% free!! Not like the other apps I have tried. You may get an ad or two but it\u2019s nothing that ruins your experience. Definitely worth it for the great stories I have found!!\n\nIt\u2019s very simple to use simply find your stories and subscribe and every day you\u2019ll have a comic to read!!\n\nI\u2019d love it if the creators of the app did three things, I\u2019d love to have reading lists. I just want the ones I\u2019m actively reading in one list and the ones I\u2019m currently waiting to read in another.  Secondly, I\u2019d like better admin moderation in the discover tab. There is a lot of stollen images and content floating around there. Finally I\u2019d like for their to be an adult section, not porn exclusively. Hear me out! There are stories that have some adult messages and nudity that have great plots and artwork that don\u2019t get featured because of said nudity and adult messages. They don\u2019t hide them but you have to dive deep into the depth of the discovery section to find good stories sometimes because of this kinda block.","334":"Am I the only one that has had a problem recently with coins? A few months ago, I had about fifteen coins that I got for free by participating in the WEBTOON Now Series. One day, I checked the app and all of my coins were gone, all the webtoon\u2019s I subscribed to were gone and I had to subscribe to them again. Where did they go? Also why Daily Pass? I was gonna reread Where Tangents Meet, which is amazing, and I couldn\u2019t go past episode eight unless I used a daily pass which is so infuriating because even when there were no daily passes on this webtoon, it took me at least a week to finish it, even though it\u2019s a short story. I don\u2019t know why Daily Pass is a thing, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good at all. It takes away the joy of a WEBTOON finally being completed and being able to binge-read them.","335":"Ok so I love this app a lot I think it\u2019s great and that but I have a little complain i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me or the app, so I was reading this webtoon I just started reading it and fell in love with it I loved it, but one day I was reading the webtoon and I had to do something so I left the phone on my bed and went to do something I came back and i saw it had went back to my home screen but I clicked on webtoon and looked for the comic I couldn\u2019t find it in my recents I was on like ep 15 or 14 and I looked for it in all my recents but couldn\u2019t find it I think the name was \u201cjust one\u201d or idk but I searched for it and couldn\u2019t find it and this has happend a couple of times idk but I can\u2019t even find it anymore :((","336":"I've had this app for about 2 years now and it is still the greatest app ever! If you like reading webcomics this is the app for you! They're are so many great and wonderful stories that you will absolutely get obsessed with! Not to mention they're all free!! They do have this fast pass thing but it's only for the lastest chapters of a series and over time they become free anyway but it's not on all the comics , Not to mention the coins for fast pass or like 5$ max but honestly you won't resist and buy on impulse lol And to top it off they give you tips, advice and pretty much a whole done deal package on how to start a webcomic and put your own story on this app. It's great!! You won't regret trust me!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","337":"I really enjoy the diverse stories on this app as well as the art. However, there are a few things I wish would change. For example some of the events to get free coins have not been working since last year and frankly that\u2019s upsetting. It\u2019s more of a scam to get users to read more webtoons. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting peoples work out there lying to users is not okay. And it doesn\u2019t seem very ethical of such a big company to do. I have lost over 20 coins over the past few events and I am not okay with that. Additionally there should be something limiting comments that mention money and fast pasases every single comic that allows these is full of these comments and frankly I don\u2019t care to know who\u2019s read ahead and wants to spoil the story for others. There should be more sensory over that.","338":"When I discovered that this app now supports iPads I was stoked as the other app wouldn\u2019t let me login and I wanted the larger screen to read on, but there are still some issues. First it took a few tries to get the app to let me login even with the correct info. After logging in I found that all of my reading process was gone (which is not too big of a deal I can just keep up with my spot between my phone and iPad). The big issue I found however is that the picture quality has been reduced quite a lot which was not a problem on the now discontinued iPad app. The artwork of the webtoons is one of the main reasons I enjoy reading them. It\u2019s a shame that all of the artists hard work cannot be appreciated on the iPad. The pictures look as if they have been blown up from a smaller screen. Please fix this.","339":"WEBTOON is my go to site for comics and fun, but their new policy restricts new artists\u2019 story lines and have forced many of them to new sites as they were depending on that income. Originally, this platform was a place for all aspiring comic artists, and many people were encouraged to start their careers as creators on discover (a place anyone can post comics on and where all WEBTOON creators start), but many people\u2019s original stories are either having to be changed because of this policy or are being forced to different sites. I want to change that. I love and have loved WEBTOON for years and will continue to because the accumulation of genres and art styles is wonderful, and I highly recommend you try it. I am currently rating this so low because I hope WEBTOON will change their policy, but I hope you will try this platform, enjoy it, and join the cause to help new creators on discover.","340":"I love Webtoon. I originally got this app about 3-4 years ago. I deleted and got this app back so many times because I was way too addicted.  I just hate how you can\u2019t see where you left off after you deleted the app. All the comics you favorited stays but what episode you on doesn\u2019t. Also on some stories they added daily passes and I was really upset. For example, I was reading the comic Noblesse and I left off around 250 eps. When I got this app back I went to read it and not only did I forget exact what episode I was on, I couldn\u2019t even read it because of the Daily Passes. This was with other comics too. \nSo for this reason I give it a 4 or 3.5 star rating. I really do love this app and the creators on this. But it is extremely annoying at times.","341":"The app is really good. I love reading the Comics in it. The only thing I have a problem with is the downloading thing. I don\u2019t think that the users of the app should be able to download their reading only one time.\nI recently downloaded Season 2 of one of the stories that I was reading and when I downloaded it, it said that I could only download it once, and had a 30 day limit. I never got to read some of the episodes of that Webtoon story, and now I can\u2019t re-download it for later.\n\nI was just wondering why users of the app could only download Episodes only once. What if someone decided to download something but then had to delete it. They wouldn\u2019t be able to download it again.","342":"I\u2019ve been using webtoon for almost three years now and it\u2019s one of my favorite pastimes, but recently i\u2019ve noticed that there is a daily pass needed for completed webtoons. I was going to reread my favorite one, Ghost Wife, for the fifth time, but I am unable to due to this issue. I thought it was simply a bug but upon seeing the other review here I know it isn\u2019t. If this becomes a trend with all completed webtoons I may have to switch over to another app simply because this used to be something with options for people who are unable to spend money on such things. It\u2019s a great app otherwise, but this new issue is something that may cause you to lose readers who don\u2019t want to pay to (re)read older webtoons. Please fix this.","343":"This used to be such an amazing open source app for fans and new artists...\n\nNow it\u2019s trash...\n\nDaily Pass, If you don\u2019t know, is a system that was recently introduced to this app. It used to work like this, you want to read a few episodes about a new story that you recently came across... and you could literally read it until you\u2019re phone died. It was a platform for new artists to release their works on the Internet for others to view and get noticed as well as feedback etc.\n\nNow with the introduction of daily pass you now can only view a small amount of episodes\/chapters and then have to pay to view more, and then once you finish all the episodes that they have available they also introduce a new system where you could pay even more money which is something they called fast pass or whatever it is, Which allows you to view three additional episodes that all the other readers would have to wait to see... \n\nIn other words, this application started off very well and it was humble and respected its readers and artist through open source viewership, however now it\u2019s become a profit driven money mill.\n\nMost of the series listed by web toons cannot be found on other sources, so fret not friends! We\u2019ll take our ad revenue elsewhere!","344":"I have been on WEBTOON for quite a while, but some bugs happened recently that would make my page glitch and not be able to go into an episode. On multiple occasions, I even had to delete my app and re-download it. It would also just kick me out of the app, and nowadays this happens about 50-60 times per day. It\u2019s really sad because in my opinion, this is probably the best comic app I have come across with both great stories, and the not needing to pay for episodes. Another issue is the daily pass. I was looking through some of the completed series I was subscribed to, and saw the daily pass. I had to wait 2 months to completely finish Bastard, and I was left on a cliffhanger SO many times. WEBTOON! Please fix these issues!","345":"I've been using Webtoons for years now and have read so many works from different artists. I often re-read these webtoons several times. Now with the new daily pass system, I'd have to return everyday for months just to finish some of these completed webtoons; As someone who likes to reread a few chapters a day, and return to the webtoon days\/weeks later when I have enough time, this system is terrible, especially when there are so many completed works out there and only TWO free daily passes to use. \n\nI understand the system for fast passes, since those are for webtoons that still update regularly. But to only be able to read two chapters a day, from webtoons that are already completed and I have already read, seems incredibly unfair and ridiculous. There are several webtoons with well over 200, even 300, episodes\/chapters.","346":"I love this app and reading the webtoons here, there are tons of great stories and wonderful artist I want to support.  I have had problems since updating my iPad though, the app no longer works\/won\u2019t load the comics so I have to resort to their website, but the website also has some kind of glitch that prevents me from logging in.  So while I get to read the comics that are up online, I can\u2019t subscribe, follow, like, or comment on any of the artists and comics that I would like to show support for.  Additionally, there are lots of little messages saying that the app is sometimes 4 chapters ahead of what is online, so its frustrating to want to read the comics and have an account for the app, but not be able to use it (this has been the case for months now, I can\u2019t see it getting fixed anytime soon T-T )","347":"For a while I have been using Webtoon to read my stories on the regular online site, then I decided to make an account, right? After a few days I tried to sign into my account and it says \u201cThis email is not registered\u201d. So I attempt to sign up again, it then tells me that \u201cThis email has already been registered.\u201d Then I go and try to reset it, and put in the new password and the email, but it continues and continues to tell me that the email has already been registered. But then all of a sudden it isn\u2019t when I try to sign up with the same email. I have went through each and every letter to make sure the email is correct when signing up and logging in. But it still doesn\u2019t work, so for now I cannot use my actual account to go on the app. Please help, Thank you!","348":"I love this app and the amazing stories I have the privilege of coming across through this app, but the new way of updating has thrown everything off. I\u2019ll get a notification letting me know when the newest installment has come out (along with just keeping track of it), but when I go to check the comic it says I have to wait almost another week before I can even read it?\nI know the authors and artists need their own commission, but if I am waiting for the next installment without spending money every day, it is extremely unfair for me to have to check back when I know it should be available, only for me to read the same episode I already read and have to wait an extra 5 days to see what happens next.","349":"I\u2019ve had this app on my phone for a long time, and I would often find myself offloading it and then coming back in a few months and binging my favorite comics, however I deleted it the second it told me I had to buy a fast pass to view content that was once free. I get that the developers need to make money and all, but there are better ways of doing that than stopping people from reading the comics altogether if they don\u2019t pay. Honestly even if they just added ridiculous amounts of adds and said you had to pay to get rid of them I wouldn\u2019t even be writing this review right now since I would still be able to read the comics. I know that you can wait to see the next episode but by then I will have lost interest anyway, so I don\u2019t see a point in keeping this app on my phone. This was a great app, but it was ruined when money became the priority. Please just find a better way to make money.","350":"The app was great but at some point it stopped working. I got a new phone recently but that wasn\u2019t the cause as it was working fine in the first few weeks. One day as I was minding my business and reading through Webtoon I go to fast pass a chapter and it says (not directly quoted) \u201cSorry we\u2019re experiencing some network issues right now. Try again later.\u201d Now this is all fine and dandy and I decide to just wait until the next day to buy it. Mind you I had quite enough credits or whatever and I was connected to Wifi and everything. Next day, still doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s been about a month since this problem has been occurring up to this day and I decided to just now comment on it. I have an account, I have currency and I have no clue what the actual problem is.","351":"I love the WEBTOON app, and I read Webtoons almost every day, so I was very disappointed to find out that you can only subscribe to 100 Webtoons. I understand that storage could be an issue, and it might be disappointing to creators because many subscribers don't read their comic every update. I subscribe to comics because either I'm going to read it in the future or I'm going to read it immediately. It depends on how interesting I think the comic is. I know many people have the same problem I do, so I think to solve this problem, you should either get rid of the limit or increase it to maybe 200 and add a wish list for the comics we want to read in the future. That way, there won't be many ghosts. If there already is a wish list, I have not noticed, so please make it more noticeable in the app.","352":"Honestly probably one of the most entertaining apps that I have, but the only thing that bothers me is the downloads thing. The bookmark feature is amazing, the issue is that after the 30 days the download expires (which makes sense). But how come I\u2019m unable to redownload it? It might be a bug since I downloaded a couple, (like 200+), episodes of Tower of God, but I got to episode 250 ish and it won\u2019t let me redownload it so I can read them when my connection\u2019s not that good. It\u2019s a little annoying since it\u2019ll download episode 300 and up, but not the ones that I haven\u2019t read yet. Essentially it\u2019s keeping me from reading up to 300 but idk if it\u2019s a bug, so if it is it\u2019ll be cool if you guys could fix it \ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","353":"I\u2019ve loved this app for as long as I\u2019ve had it . I can\u2019t recall how long but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been like 2 years now ? And I love everything about this app . It\u2019s amazing and especially because I love reading and I love drawing . So just seeing the wonderful art work and getting a great story at the same time is fantastic . But lately I haven\u2019t been able to download any story at all . I\u2019ve deleted all of my downloads so maybe it would let me but it still hasn\u2019t . I deleted the app and got it back still didn\u2019t work . I also updated it and it\u2019s still not working . Please help ): the only reason I download them is to show friends at school and read at school because my WiFi is really bad there .","354":"I love webtoon, reading other webtoon a from others that have spent their time and day just to make us entertained and to share a story is amazing. People work hard in order to plan a story, draw, and to have the courage to make it public. What I dislike though is the new policy; the new policy is stopping others(who work hard) just because people report their hard work. Just because it\u2019s NSFW doesn\u2019t mean you have to report. They already have this warning and to just report them anyways when YOU clicked it is just rude. The new policy is holding down the creators just because they can\u2019t post what others desire and what they feel proud about. Please consider the new policy and change it to make sure others don\u2019t report so easily and such, the creators have feelings too. Thank you for reading.","355":"When i have a strong urge to read webcomics for pleasure, I turn to a few apps, and Webtoons is by far my most favorite. Due to its efficient design, there\u2019s always a chance to explore new webcomics while also being able to scroll through your favorite one & support the artists. \nThere\u2019s a great variety of genres as well as art styles so everyone should be able find what suits their interests. \nArt is one thing, but webcomics are a whole other form of art, one that entertains, inspires, uplifts, & is a great boredom relief, etc. For all occasions, this app is perfect for the bit of entertainment you are looking for. \nIts always a pleasure to find apps such as this which i feel i will enjoy for years to come.","356":"Don\u2019t get me wrong I love webtoon and some of the stories on it. I\u2019ve used webtoon for a VERY long time and it has some of my all time favorites such as Lumine. HOWEVER they started a new thing called daily passes where you can only read a few episodes of many finished stories a day. I understand maybe they need people to be using coins and stuff but I like to binge. Luckily I\u2019ve finished a lot of the stories this has happened to however I wanted to reread but it was to much of a hassle to deal with only 1-3 episodes a day! I\u2019m not trying to be mean and I know webtoon probably has a reason for this but it ruined it for me. I\u2019m not that patient. I still highly recommend getting this app since it has some amazing stories. It\u2019s just no longer for me and I wish they handed implicated the daily passes.","357":"This app is amazing! Not only do you get a wide variety of genres, you don\u2019t have to pay to read a comic! Instead of paying you just have to wait for the comic to be unlocked. In other comics, instead of waiting, the artist just makes you watch an ad instead of waiting. You can buy coins for fast pass but the good thing is you don\u2019t have to just read your comic. you have a choice! Also the art and storylines are awesome! And every artist has their own style and the artist cares a lot about the readers and sometimes has their own Q and As. Overall this is just the tip of the iceberg when describing Webtoon. I definitely recommend that you try this wonderful app!","358":"I realize that this kind of thing could maybe be reported on some kind of bug submission board, but I feel like when a problem has to do with the app, a review is a good place to do it AND a review is more likely to get the attention of the developers. \n\nThere are a couple little things that need to be fixed and then this review will change to a 5 star rating. As an app developer, I know that these changes are super easy and shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple weeks at the most to implement and test.\n\n1- When you navigate to a new chapter, it resets the orientation to right side up portrait mode....even if you have your iPad LOCKED into upside down portrait or horizontal mode... meaning every time you go to the next chapter, you have to flip your iPad all about to get it to correct. Honestly annoying af. But also this is an easy fix. \n\n2-issue with remembering where I was last reading. Often I\u2019ll tap on a favorite comic only to be set back like 2 chapters...also super annoying, but also a simple fix.\n\nThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the price of a 5 star review all written out, fix those things and it\u2019s all yours! Good luck, keep up the good work.","359":"As soon as I got it, it gave me choices and asked me what I was interested in. Which I appreciate. However, I started a comic today and I got on chapter 73, and was like \u201cskip with a fast pass\u201d or something of that nature. I was baffled, I was getting at a really good part and you could see the disappointment on my face. I was unaware that you had to pay. The advertisements say \u201cfree comics\u201d. I\u2019m not complaining on how you must pay to continue, I\u2019m complaining on the fact there isn\u2019t any other way to get coins rather than pay. Like watch an ad for example. Every single thing I own on my phone has that option and it\u2019s great quality also. It\u2019s a friendly recommendation, I feel as though people wouldn\u2019t get tired of it as quick. Rather than waited ten days for one episode. I imagine it gets tiring.","360":"I personally enjoy this app a lot. One of my favorites. However, I was reading and suddenly it logged me out and I thought ok whatever I\u2019ll just log back in. Then it turned out that email that I had made an account with no longer registered and I had to redo my account. This infuriated me because I was subscribed to several different series and it would take me a long time to resubscribe to all of them. Not only that, but all of my coins were lost as well! This was immensely upsetting since coins cost money and aren\u2019t cheap. I hope that I was the only victim of this bug and that it gets fixed soon. I\u2019ll just spend the next few hours attempting to find all of the series that I was subscribed to in the meantime.","361":"Please try and create a new policy when the person gets WEBTOON that they put in their age and scans the email for the age. Because I love webtoon so many good and great comics but they screwed it up cause they put in a new policy I\u2019ve seen creators who have left and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people leave webtoon and follow the creators to another app. But it\u2019s sad because I mean look at everything each creator puts into the comic. It screws them up. So please create an age group so they can see comics fit to their age. Cause it really made me sad seeing all of these good creators leaving when they should need to or have to but they do cause of the dang policy they put in. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this review. But I\u2019m not tying to give webtoon a bad rep or anything I just thing it\u2019s unfair to the creators and to a lot of the readers.","362":"I've used several apps to read for free, but this is the best one! Please read my entire review, because some people complain needlessly!\n\nWhat is does:: It keeps track of everything you read in case you forget, allows you to subscribe to the ones you like (and get notified of updates), and lets you DOWNLOAD so you can read on the go! \n\nIMPORTANT points & problems:: \n\n1) The downloads can take a bit, but if you're patient you can take the whole webtoon with you~ \n\n2) Recent allows you to know which comics you just read, subscribed keeps track of the ones recently updated. If you remember that, you should be golden. The downside is, if you want to read a finished comic and you haven't looked at it recently, you have to scroll through your recents or subsriptions. \n\n3) The website allows you to upload your own comics, but you can't do that on the app \n\n4) There're ads that support the freedom of it, but it's easy to get used to them. You're helping support the authors you're reading for free. Most of them also have Patreon (look it up) too, so you can support them directly.","363":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOONs for about a year now and it\u2019s great, except for some minor problems. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me. On some days when I enter the app it would show the normal green WEBTOON loading screen, but after a couple of seconds just exit out and show my home screen. Though the very next day it would work completely fine as if nothing had happened, so it didn\u2019t bother me. This exact occurrence would happen on multiple occasions. As I said before it didn\u2019t bother me, until just recently it stopped working. I waited one day like I usually do and checked, but it didn\u2019t work. Waited couple more days, still didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s my internet or phone, but please fix this.","364":"Love the app, I\u2019ve been using for quite awhile now. However, there was a free coin challenge I completed about a week ago. It was a huge disappointment to see that I had no coins at all when I went to go use it on a free pass. The app said I had to log out of an device that I previously used and log onto this one. But the device that was logged in was the device I was using right now. I then proceeded to switch devices because they were the same. Even when I did that, I still didn\u2019t receive my coins. The app was up to date as well. I won\u2019t be to petty about it however, I would still like to receive the coins that I was supposed to earn.","365":"Hi, so I bought coins and I Reyes the fast pass once and I enjoyed it but then the next week when it was supposed to have a new ep it was the same one that I had used the fast pass on. So I am asking that when you used the fast pass for an episode then when the next episode comes can you not make it where you have to wait one more week so you can have the next episode because I don\u2019t want to use the fast pass for two episodes of the same WEBTOON but then have to wait two more weeks till the next one because I already used two fast pass for the two episodes so when the new week comes plz make the next episodes come out thank you!","366":"Webtoon is actually a very addicting app where artists and readers from all around the world can get together and read and illustrate amazingly fun and addicting stories. Some problems are that discover webtoons are barely read, known, or liked compared to the webtoon canvas stories. I\u2019m not sure how you can fix this, but it would be really nice if you did,,, I\u2019m an artist myself and it reallmakes me sad to see other artists out there feeling down or incapable because of the lack of attention their hard work gets. Overall I think webtoon is an amazing way for artists to thrive and feel great about their art (comments) as their readers cheer them on! Please consider downloading!! \u2728\ud83d\udc95","367":"I love webtoon and all the stories on it, the amount of awesome artist i've found and intricate stories is amazing. the daily pass feature is so annoying, it takes the fun out of binging a series and looking back at completed comics, and it would prolong that time for months which at that point i would've been fed up. I loved a comic called orange marmalade and waited YEARS for the artist to finish Days of Hana so i could binge the full thing and now the daily pass is making so i have to wait for the next episodes which is exactly what i was trying to avoid (obviously i wouldn't care if it was currently being updated and i had to wait for the next one but the fact thats it completed and all uploaded annoys me). I don't mind the fast pass just cause it doesn't affect the reading that much","368":"I wish I could have given this app five stars. And before the latest update, I would have. This app is amazing and honestly one of the best things out there. I love the stories on here, and most of the policies I don\u2019t mind that much. However, the recent update with these ads to allow me to read the next chapter in a series is obnoxious. As much as I love this app, this new update might kill my love for it. I specifically don\u2019t play games with too many ads, and when you\u2019re reading multiple stories, the ads can tend to pile up. I am so disappointed with the creators of this app, and will be taking back all of my referrals to everyone I talk to. I really hope the creators of this app take the ads down soon, or I may be switching back to regular books instead.","369":"So this is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL app, and I don\u2019t have any other problems than this: this started yesterday, I was trying to read a comic I like but when I clicked on it the episodes wouldn\u2019t load and there was no way to get back to the menu or anything, so I decided to exit the app and close it and give it some time Incase I just need to let it load or something. However when I tried to get to the same comic again it gave me the episode buffering thing and then it showed me an empty comic with zero likes and zero comments, and there was no way to exit! Please fix this, I adore this app and I would love to use it again!!","370":"There are some series that have a new chapter weekly, but right above are the 3 latest chapters and for 5 coins you can read one or 15 coins you can read all 3. The drawback is if you don\u2019t want to pay again, you have to wait A MONTH to continue reading. Last week I was reading a series and was really hyped for what will happen. So I paid the 15 coins (5 coins I earned and the other 10 I paid 99 cents for) and read ahead. Next day I realized, do I have to wait until the next chapter is free to read it? I didn\u2019t want to pay anymore. Here I am after that week and yep, the new chapter will be free in 21 days. \n\nIf you guys find a series you really like, be patient, especially if you don\u2019t want to pay for content.","371":"This app is addictive. I love all the art work and I can tell how much the authors put their time and effort into each episode. I look forward to every webtoon I read each day. I can\u2019t stop starting new ones. Now I can say that I do read a lot even though it is on a screen. (It would be nice to have some in an actual book). I recommend this app to anyone who is looking to read comics or need something to do while they are bored. There is a webtoon for everyone because of all the genres. (I personally like the romance) I get so happy when I find out my friends use webtoon because I have someone to freak out with. \n\nI hope that whoever tries webtoon has a great experience!!!! \n\n-Kenzie","372":"I\u2019ve been getting on Webtoons multiple times a day for months now and it has given me much joy. Supporting authors by giving them a platform is truly an amazing thing to see and be apart of. However Webtoons now has a new policies which enforces that Mature 18+ content is no longer allowed even if censored. This is so stifling to the art; the freedom of expression this app once had. Until Webtoons changes this, I will not support them anymore because they are no longer supporting their authors that make up the viewers, who are being forced to pull their material from the app after laboring for hours to create it. I gave this one star because of what Webtoons has done to its own supporters.","373":"Short and simple. I really love the app and stories on it but honestly the daily pass has made using it so frustrating. There are several stories I loved re reading that were completed like bastard and now to re read the storie I\u2019d have to read one chapter a day for over a month or pay a bunch of money. Not only that but they also made it so the pass goes away after 14 days so then if you want to read it I have to do one chapter a day for a month. It\u2019s completely stupid. There\u2019s another app I use that does something similar but once you use a daily pass the episode is unlocked forever which is a way better system that doesn\u2019t try to steal money from people using the app to read something that is one already finished and that I\u2019ve already read several times. They really need to get rid of it.","374":"I have had this app for almost 2 years and I really like it! But when the last update came I have been getting a problem, so basically it would say that my internet connections was bad but when I would go check my internet it would say it was fine and other apps it was fine. And no matter how much I left it alone or said retry, it would only work when I deleted the app and then download it again. Right now I am about to delete it again because \u201cthe internet is bad\u201d I still love webtoon but this bug is really annoying (especially for the series I a, not subscribed to yet) anyway over all love it, but I really hope u guys could fix this.","375":"So about 6 months ago I downloaded WEBTOON for the second time (the first time I was 10, and most of it flew over my head). I didn\u2019t set the stakes high, thinking \u201cIt\u2019s just a comic app.\u201d Well, I was wrong. I totally underestimated it. There are many good stories, and most update once a week, which I don\u2019t mind because I know the authors work hard to post episodes. Many genres as well, ranging from superhero to romance to thriller to comedy, the list goes on and on. If you are reading this review, I suggest many many comics, but a few are: Brimstone and Roses, Lore Olympus, Adventures of God, My Dictator Boyfriend, Let\u2019s Play, and Not Even Bones. (And many more of course). But seriously, download the app.","376":"WEBTOON is an amazing site and I adore all the stories they collect and share but this app absolutely DOES NOT WORK FOR IPAD. I have this on my iphone and it works perfectly fine, but try to go into the app while on an IPad and you get booted out within a few seconds. I downloaded this thinking that having it on the bigger screen of my iPad would be better for me rather than sometimes having to squint at my phone while also running its battery down. Instead I downloaded the app logged into my account and then immediately after the app shut itself down. Open it again hoping it was just a bug ,but instead  end up on my home screen again. I\u2019ve tried multiple times to get this to open and stay open but it just doesn\u2019t work.","377":"I\u2019ve been a member of Webtoon since 2017, but progressively, I seem to be having more and more problems with the app. It started with the app frequently crashing (possibly due to lack of space on my phone). However, after I freed up space, webcomics would glitch and overlap one another in random panels. It didn\u2019t even have to be from the same comic. Sometimes I\u2019d be reading like Lore Olympus and suddenly a panel from MDCBK would pop up at a random spot and it wouldn\u2019t go away unless I left the comic entirely and returned to it. Also, I got an iPhone 7 recently and now the app won\u2019t let me log in at all... it works on all of my other phones but this one. Not sure if this is user error or the app\u2019s, but I\u2019d like to be able to use one phone for all of my apps...","378":"I\u2019m a pretty new user to Webtoon , and I loved it so far. Especially Not Even Bones. Until I realized that the last three episodes were locked. Either you could buy it with five coins, or wait an entire WEEK. For one episode? No offense, but I ain\u2019t waiting THAT long for an episode. The episode that follows is two WEEKS. And as someone who can\u2019t pay five dollars every time I want to watch a Webtoon, I find that discouraging. Now, a day or two might\u2019ve been okay, but I really think that a week is WAY too long. Even though I have loved the webtoons, waiting so long has discouraged me and made me delete the app. In the future, if this happens to change, I might download it again. \n\nOther than that, if you\u2019re willing to pay a lot of money, then I totally recommend this app! It has great stories.","379":"But the story\u2019s are on pause and they have been like that for over 3 months by now and I truly respect that they need their time to rest but I also think why did u start such a good story if ur going to be gone for 3 months and it gets me sad and mad bc I want to read something and the story says that is going to come back in like a month or two like every story I read is on pause. I am very serious, I have a lot of story\u2019s that I am reading and 15 of them are on pause and one of them have been pause for like 8 months!!!! I love this app and everything but I think WEBTOON should talk with the people who create the story to start writing them again. I get they need their time but sometimes is too much!","380":"I love WEBTOON. It\u2019s a great app for creators to be able to post their content and for people to enjoy it. There has been an issue that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the app or the comics author but a few comics have the ad before read the chapter. That\u2019s not the problem. When I go to watch the ad to read an error comes up saying I have to do something in my device settings. I went to it and there was nothing there that the directions said. I have photos of one example but I can\u2019t add them here. I have even refreshed it and reinstalled the app and it still comes up. I also have tried it on wifi and data and the same thing comes up. I really love this app and hope that this is just a bug that will be fixed soon.","381":"I hate reading, I\u2019ll just say that. I\u2019m a midteen and I hate reading. This app is great. Not only are the all reads free, but you can even DOWNLOAD THEM!!! The downloads disappear after 30 days due to copy right but that is understandable!! This app does have a skip pass, when a author sends out a few new chapters they keep them for a few days before publishing them. The skip pass lets you skip the few days and read it without the 5 day wait. It\u2019s a easy simple way they can make profit and not force you to pay, but to wait a few days. Everything is easy to understand and I love it. Btw shout out to the following stories if you like drama and thrill.  True Beauty. Unordinary. Phase!!","382":"I really love webtoon! I love reading all the comics. It made me get a variety of reading preferences. I love reading the BL and the other romance and fantasy webtoons. Recently you guys just made a new policy and it makes it harder for the artist to go on with the story line or people who want to see the mature scenes can\u2019t spend money on patreon which is really used for extra scenes and faster reading. I would really like if you changed the policy back to the original or gave it more of a variety for the readers and the authors. I feel like it would help a lot. But I really do love the app but I still want to be able to read some of the mature scenes even if it is censored but now you can even have that. Thanks!","383":"So I\u2019ve seen a few reviews on how after 7 days of waiting the webtoon didn\u2019t update and how they thought it was a glitch. Just wanted to say, it wasn\u2019t a glitch the authors sometimes postpone the update another week and sometimes they go on hiatus. I think WEBTOON is great because most manga or webtoon apps make you wait for every single episode after episode 3 but on webtoon, you only have to wait for the newest ones and you can use fast passes like any other manga app. Another great thing about this is there are no ads except for ads about the webtoons, there are no pop-ups, the search part is really easy to search with and etc","384":"Webtoon, as much as i love you i hate to admit that after fast pass, daily pass is one of the worst updates you could have ever done. I understand yall need money to keep the company going but cant you do that in different ways? Even a pop-up ad after every episode wouldve been a whole lot less annoying, along with the choice to buy the ads off. For people like me, i lose interest in Webtoon every few months but come back with the urge to check up on my favorite webtoons, some finished while some in work, but with the new daily pass it\u2019s the same as waititng a week for a new episode. Most of these webtoons have over 100+ episodes, so waiting a day for one episode is insane! It could take someone an entire year just to read a completed webtoon again. Reconsider your actions, take away the update we all hate it.","385":"I thought the daily pass was a good idea for series that were still ongoing and gave us the opportunity to pay for a fast pass to read an extra chapter if we didn\u2019t want to wait a whole week to continue a series. What I with many other loyal fans have a problem with is that with all previous completed series that had NO LIMIT to how many chapters we could read in one sitting before 2019 now only have the first five chapters free. After that if you want to continue reading the completed series you need a daily pass for each chapter which is ridiculous, and a slap in the face to older fans who have been using this app for years. Many of us wouldn\u2019t be so upset if the completed series wouldn\u2019t had been free from the beginning. The fact that now they\u2019re behind a paywall shows that they have just became another cash grab app.","386":"I really like webtoon and all, it\u2019s an overall great app with amazing comics. I do like how they are branching out and trying new things like fast pass and doing more events, but daily pass is just a scam. It\u2019s really annoying when you want to reread or read an completed webtoon. This is especially annoying and not worth it if you\u2019ve already reread it. It just seems like a way for them to get money and it is honestly so annoying. I just want to reread the completed webtoon but I can\u2019t. I get fast pass and all because it would have been the same amount of episodes with and without fast pass and if you have the money, you can skip ahead. But daily pass is to much of a hassle.","387":"I love WEBTOON! But what is up with this daily pass update? I am going on a 12+ hour road trip soon and was planning to reread soon older WEBTOONs. I was so excited!! But now I am unable to do that. I have been with WEBTOONs since 2017 I believe and have loved almost every second of it. WEBTOON has help me through some rocky moments in my life and I would hate for that to change. Now I understand that you are a company and you need to make money but this is not the way to do it. All I ask is that you reconsider this update. As a teenager I do not have much money and my parent don\u2019t  want me spending  money on WEBTOONs weekly! I have a feeling that this will definitely cause people to distance their selves from the app out of annoyance. I do wish this app the best of luck and I do hope you find another way to make money without the daily passes. \n\n- a worried reader","388":"webtoon is a really great app for sharing stories and i absolutely adore that ! but unfortunately i\u2019m not so happy with the new policy, that is, about mature content. i understand the idea and what they\u2019re trying to get at, but all it really does is affect creator\u2019s content that they worked so hard on. and it also is unfortunate that readers will not be able to read what they were waiting for. most artists\/creators put warnings before the mature content, so if someone doesn\u2019t want to read something like that they can easily avoid it. so i think that the new policy is a hassle and does more damage than help. webtoon is an amazing app and i love it but that policy throws me off, i hope the people in charge of webtoon discard of it soon (please) ;-;","389":"Hi my name is Dante! I think this is the greatest app of all time ! I love the comedy, I love the drama , I love the romantic stuff. I totally recommend this app too me I have Tourette syndrome reading these help my Tourette\u2019s a little it soothes them a little. I also have a learning disability and I for one since I have started reading these comics my reading has gotten better I practice all the time ! It gets better and better! I totally recommend this app it has sooooo many choices , so many amazing stories , so many stories with music in them ! I recommend the story Bluechair it always made me cheer up on rainy days and when I\u2019m angry too it\u2019s funny too me ! I love this app so much ! Thank you for reading this !","390":"I absolutely loved WEBTOON until recently. Authors and creators being able to publish their stories in this way was amazing, and I'm sure nearly all readers and subscribers agree. But this new policy, if you aren't so oblivious to see, has hurt more than it has helped. There should have been a way to regulate stories and content if you were so adamant about it rather than outright ban. Quite a few of the stories I am subscribed to have been negatively affected by the new policy. I wholeheartedly believe that most of the readers are on here are mature audiences with different interests. All the stories I read with mature content gave warning beforehand. You highly encourage WEBTOON to rethink its recent policy implementation.","391":"WEBTOON has gone down hill!!! I mean there crazy why in the world would they decide to change the rules so nsfw isn\u2019t allowed that is just cruel if a writer has things in there writing that are so inappropriate then when not just have a age setting in the beginning so they know the age of readers and only age appropriate readers can see the so called inappropriate content like come on if they don\u2019t change the rules soon me and my friends are thinking to ditch the app and I know there are others how may have or are also planning to do the same. So dear people at webtoon stop making everything so hard on your writers and fix the issue the long way instead of cutting corners because if you don\u2019t this app won\u2019t last nearly as long as it should. Please don\u2019t be stupid. P.S there is no swearing in my review for one reason I\u2019m trying to be the bigger person here so please just fix the issue soon. Thank you.","392":"I have to say I am addicted to the WEBTOONs app. I can tell that the artists put a lot of hard work into their art. However, I\u2019ve been having this ongoing problem with logging in.  Every time I login into the app with my line account it works for like 5 seconds until I start reading a comic. When I want to thumbs up a comment or subscribe to a new comic I am prompted to log in yet again and then I am sent to the line app where I click that I accept the mini contract. I have to do that every time, it\u2019s become so annoying that I don\u2019t even bother logging in on my phone anymore. This problem doesn\u2019t seem to be happening on my computer. Besides that I truly enjoy the quality of the app but this small bug is quite irritating.","393":"I love this app, great comics, easy to use and all the other things you\u2019ll want. One concern I\u2019ve been seeing is how bad their guidelines are when it comes to \u201cReporting\u201d comments. I\u2019ve just came back from reading a comic where there was a user commenting VERY hateful\/ transphobic comments and I reported it and all it said was \u201c comment reported\u201d I believe there should be different categories in order to properly report someone and their account so it does not happen again. People should get banned from commenting after saying such disgusting things. Again, the app is great and many are friendly but there should still be a better security system when it comes to negative comments.","394":"I try to like or subscribe and it opens a log in page that is basically just the home page, and in which I\u2019m already logged in. I cannot log out to try to log back in because the log out button doesn\u2019t work. Not to mention that it keeps switching to portrait orientation from my preferred landscape; I actually tend to have to go back once to switch orientations because the want to subscribe button switches it to portrait and doesn\u2019t allow it to switch back automatically after being closed. This is all really frustrating because the app worked perfectly a year or two ago when I first installed it. Between these issues and the log in issue some months back, I\u2019ve actually stopped using Webtoons because I don\u2019t use my computer enough to make reading on a browser practical.","395":"I LOVE WEBTOON. An amazing app that keeps making improvements. The only thing that really bothers me when I use it constantly, is that when u scroll to a certain webtoon on ur list and then read it and go back to all of your subscribed webtoons, it starts you at the top of the list instead of where u left off. So I always have to scroll all the way back down to where I left off on my list. If you could place a bookmark on the main list of where I left off, my experience would be 100 times better. This is something that\u2019s been on my mind and I just wanted to let you know. Thanks for the amazing experience!!!","396":"I love WEBTOONs and it help me read a lot more than I have ever read in my life the last time I read was at least 3 to 4 years ago and after that  my friend showed me this app and I fell in love with it and it is making me sad that this new policy is ruining the publishers from posting anything that they would like to be posted that matches their content to their story like mature stuff which I have been reading has been a big problem now that\u2019s why they\u2019re making this policy but a story that I am reading is the cutest little story I have ever read and they may not make the story or post The next chapter again because of it so the series might be over so I am very sad about that Which is causing me to not want to read the books anymore because I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to take it off because of the new policy","397":"I love all the webtoons everything about it it\u2019s amazing the stories the drama the fantasy the comedy it\u2019s absolutely amazing the best thing I have ever downloaded it\u2019s simply amazing I couldn\u2019t ask for more then amazing story\u2019s and comics but the new policy is something I don\u2019t like is the new policy some of my favorite story\u2019s have to either remove there\u2019s pages of take down there webtoon comic I\u2019ve even seen people who are upset and mostly angry for this policy so if you can just put it back the way it was or just tell webtoon comics so add a \u201care you and adult to watch this\u201d so that way everyone can be happy I still love webtoon but I just don\u2019t want my favorite comics taken down...","398":"I truly enjoy this app, as said no glitches has happened. Of course, I\u2019ve been reading along with my stories! I truly enjoy it! I am currently a writer and a artist, so I find all these unique styles of art and writing! So far the only thing bugging me is the wait, of course everyone would be annoyed if the thing they\u2019re reading cut off in a cliffhanger and had to wait 7-5 days for it. I simply stay patient, and find other stuff to reading during the process. This app is a good way to cure boredom and makes reading enjoyable. I recommend this app for anyone, (unless you hate stuff like this, Sorry!). To wrap it up, I clearly love this app, and so should anyone else! :)","399":"This app is perfect for people who don\u2019t want to pay for manga or comics, but still revive fresh, new, hot things. People are complaining of the new addition called daily pass, but it\u2019s only improves the app. Here\u2019s why: 1. It\u2019s a way for the author to continue making money after their project is completed. People do have the option to still use coins on their comics. 2. You still get up to 3 episodes everyday depending on the comic. And 3. Once you unlock an episode you have up to 15 days to go back and reread it. WEBTOON also has other incredible comics that don\u2019t have this feature yet if you\u2019d rather read something else.","400":"Would Love to give Webtoon 5 stars, it\u2019s one of my favorite apps! But with the recent policy of mature content I sadly cannot do that. I loved the way webtoon was before, where there were genres and stories for all people, young adults and adults included. Yes some webtoons were 18+ but that is why the creators would put a warning in the beginning. Why are we limiting them their creative freedom? Also, I have read many webtoons that have had their chapters deleted for featuring \u201cexplicit content\u201d when really there was nothing there. Some creators go to other websites because this policy is not allowing them to work comfortably, such as tapas. I don\u2019t know I just wish this policy didn\u2019t exist, it was better before.","401":"The Daily Pass update really lowered my appreciation for this app. When I first started using this app, I LOVED the availability to binge read completed series. That is the #1 reason I was so hooked. I have advocated to many of my friends in favor of Webtoon prior to the limitations on completed series. I loved being able to read series from start to finish at my own pace. However, with the daily pass update that is no longer an option for so many great series. It is very discouraging to continue to use and advocate for this app when binge reading is no longer an option for series that made me love Webtoon. My current stance aligns with deleting the app once the few ongoing series I am subscribed to are completed. I will also no longer be recommending this app to others. There seems to be no incentive to continue to use Webtoons with the daily pass for completed series.","402":"I\u2019ve used WEBTOON for about 2 years. A friend recommended it to me and I got hooked so fast. I am at the point where I read MANY comics at once. A majority of which are canvas. But since there was an update where ads appeared before new episodes I\u2019ve been having a similar problem. When I click the button that lets me watch the ad so I can read the new episode, sometimes an error message came up. Today I have been having a problem with two comics, one I have been trying for three days, and one I\u2019ve been trying for all of today. But that app overall is a hit and no matter the few issues I love it.","403":"Webtoons new policy has many people who read certain webtoon unhappy this new policy affects the story line and limits the creator on what they can and can not post. I noticed that the rating dropped by .1 stars when I used to be a 4.9 rating now became a 4.8 rating this drop occurred because of the new policy which was placed. I absolutely LOVED this app when ever I was sad I would come here and read but when I read a webtoon and two characters I ship finally fall in love it makes me so happy and so does this happen for other readers but now our viewing experience is limited this makes me sad to see such a big corporation limiting its readers and creator. Webtoon please please please do something about this change! Thank you","404":"I have always wanted something to come out where people get to show their creativity and really open up... but this this is just so great. You could just sit in your favorite comfy chair and just get lost in the pages while enjoying the wonderful story\u2019s it has to offer! By all means this may just be my favorite app yet. I\u2019m not just on my iPad or phone playing games rotting my brain but I\u2019m actually reading story\u2019s and good ones at that. The characters are so likable and the art is amazing. All of the authors who took part in making some of these wonderful story\u2019s are very talented. I just really made this to say I love the idea and everything about this app!\n~*Mae*~","405":"I\u2019ve had this app for a few years and I absolutely love it. I\u2019ve never had any problems with it but earlier today I opened the app and on every single canvas series I\u2019m reading, it deleted my reading history. Like I said earlier, I have never had any problem with WEBTOON so I\u2019m going to give it 4 stars. I will change it if I can fix this problem but right now I\u2019m really confused on what to do \uff08\uff3e_\uff3e\uff09\n\nEdit: PLEASE go back to how WEBTOON used to be. The daily pass is just stupid. I understand fast pass because it gives you a choice and I helps to support the creator but the daily pass system is just annoying. I tried to reread orange marmalade because it is a amazing series but after a few episodes it said I have to wait to read the next chapter of a series that is ALREADY completed. I feel like this new update is just going to totally backfire. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude21","406":"I love webtoons so, so much. Lots of great comics to spend time on, a large variety, and pretty decent flow of good new ones to read. \nHowever there\u2019s some issues with the way it operates. Like completed webtoons suddenly only allowing one episode per day (avid binge reader here) even on webtoons I\u2019ve completed as they were released. And the coins system is broken af. If you purchase coins and use them on an episode or two and run out of coins, you then have to wait an additional week (or two depending on how many episodes you purchased ) to be able to read the next one. I\u2019d be much more inclined to spend money on coins if I didn\u2019t have to wait extra weeks to continue reading a series.","407":"I don\u2019t even know where to start. This app is amazing. The webtoons itself are good and the storyline is \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. The app is good, with really no ads except at the bottom of the comic but that\u2019s really minimal when you think about it. Every thing is free, you don\u2019t have to buy any comics or chapters so that\u2019s what I LOVE about it. Just get it try it out and see if you like it. Some good ones I personally love (romance genre) Sirens lament, Dear cold blooded king, Days of Hana, My boo and Let\u2019s play. A good funny one (if your not easily offended) is women\u2019s world and Adventures of God. A few good dramas\/humor is lookisom and Unordinary. But yea I just had to say something about it! Ahhh I love this app\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb Keep up the good work","408":"Wayyy better than tappy toon and those other apps. You can access as many chapters per day as you want, no coins necessary. A lot of comics have a fast pass option where you can read the chapters as soon as they come out, but it\u2019s kinda expensive so if ur broke like me you can just wait a week for the chapters to become free. I love that I don\u2019t have to pay money to keep up with comics\nWebtoon also has canvas comics, which are by independent creators. You can find some awesome stuff and support small artists!! I don\u2019t like going on illegal websites lbecause it basically steals from the creators, so I really like that everything on Webtoon is generally accessible :)","409":"The daily pass thing is ridiculous I can\u2019t even read orange marmalade anymore. I came to WEBTOON because it was free and I would rather a simple reading app be free then spending my money on something like that. In all the years I\u2019ve been on webtoon the only reason I\u2019ve stayed is because of such good stories that cost nothing. Every other app has made everything cost money. I ask that you take people into consideration especially the ones who cannot pay for such things as an app. I know this won\u2019t be acted upon much less seen. I enjoy apps like WEBTOON but I cannot find one like WEBTOON that is free but now WEBTOON itself won\u2019t even be that way.","410":"I just love webtoon. There are so many stories that just catch your eye! I\u2019m seriously OBSESSED with like 20 different stories! The only thing really is that I don\u2019t like how you guys have a \u201cdaily pass\u201d thing. It\u2019s really annoying when I wanna reread a story. I don\u2019t want to pay money! Especially since you guys credit your self on being free! Please make an effort to get rid of the daily pass thing and we should be able to earn coins by watching ads or something as for the next episodes that are coming in the next weeks or so. Please take my ideas \ud83d\udca1 into consideration because I really enjoy your app and use it every day but these are some  problems that I have with it.\n\nWith Love, \n\n        A user of your app","411":"Love this app. It\u2019s a great break from regular books and tv. I thought of a feature that might be useful to add. Maybe it already exists, but I haven\u2019t seen it. The idea is to have a spot on the app where you can list\/post for partnerships. For example, I\u2019m an amazing writer and lore creator, but I can\u2019t do anything art. So I could go on the posting spot of the app, find some artists who are looking for writers to collaborate with and then contact them about working on a Webtoon comic together. It\u2019d be for artists who need writers\/lore creators or writers who need artists. Or maybe even people looking to do crossovers of series that are already out. Please consider to boost up comic production!","412":"I\u2019ve gone through many apps that have stories on them because the pay to play aspect was a huge turn off and honestly not worth the money. I found Web Toon shortly before they banned NSFW content so when that happened I was irritated but chose to stick around anyway because none of my regular stories would be affected by it. Now they\u2019ve also introduced a pay to play or I guess pay to read system and if it weren\u2019t for the awesome authors who use this app I would delete it too. I\u2019m sick of watching app developers change apps to charge money for no reason other than their own greed, especially when they try to pass it off as beneficial to the authors when we all know that it doesn\u2019t. I am beyond disappointed and as soon as my authors finish their stories I too will be finishing my time with Web Toon.","413":"So I\u2019ve been reading WEBTOONS for about a year now and I have come to see different things from easy going romance to sex. To be completely honest I found interest in both. Pppthhh my first WEBTOON story I read was BL! There has been a change of things, WEBTOON can not allow people to post sexual content even though it\u2019s their art that they wanted readers to enjoy if they are Homosexual or heterosexual. WEBTOON is a very good way for homosexual introverts to help them figure out how sex works or how a boy romance or girl romance can play out. I\u2019m not sure what else to write cause I\u2019m tired and decided to write a complaint oml. ANYWAYYY sorry for any grammar errors..Also I doubt 9 year olds are on this. I\u2019m 10\/10 sure that everyone who reads this is at least 11+ cause that\u2019s a maturer age than a 9 year old and even if 11 year olds read this I doubt they would read some BL or anything sexual unless they are mentally ready.","414":"I\u2019d like to preface this by saying I really enjoy the app and like the wide variety of comics. Something that\u2019s been happening recently though is when I scroll down to open the next episode, the ad shown above the next episode button gets clicked and it kicks me out of the app. I know I\u2019m not accidentally tapping the ad, it just activates if my finger happens to swipe by it. This wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem if the app didn\u2019t crash when I try to re-enter the app. I have tried force closing the app multiple times, but that doesn\u2019t work immediately so I have to wait 5-10 minutes to use the app again. It\u2019s not a long time, but it\u2019s getting annoying.","415":"I love webtoon and get excited every time a webtoon is updated...but, because of the new update a lot of my favorite authors have had their story be taken down or can\u2019t do what they want anymore. Yes I do get that there are some underage people reading webtoon and that\u2019s okay. I just wish there is a different way to deal with NSFW content than just getting it taken down. There are older people who do read this and are getting a bit upset (myself included) because some of my favorite authors are going to have to move to a different site to post what they love doing. I love webtoon. Just not the new policy. There should be a different way to putting age restrictions on mature content rather than taking it down completely causing the author to move to different sites.","416":"While I understand why webtoon decided to change their NSFW policy, this is not fair for many of their creators and also the readers. If parents complained about their kids being exposed to that, then that\u2019s on them for not monitoring what they\u2019re watching. If they\u2019re so worried, why not implement like a \u201clock\u201d that parents can put on their account that won\u2019t let them see webtoons with a mature content rating? Completely removing the option for mature content because of them is not fair. I read many stories that are many chapters in and they now have to cancel their webtoon because the mature content was a big part of the story, its sad to see so many of them shut down. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if another website came up with better policies and webtoon slowly disappeared. Your featured stories aren\u2019t everything, yet making money off them is all you really seem to care about.","417":"I love this app so much and use it so much! I get to read interesting stories that may cover serious topics but also be lighthearted at the same time. I personally recommend Freaking Romance, True Beauty, and Lore Olympus as starter comics. The only problem I have is the Daily Pass. For the completed comics that don\u2019t update anymore, you can only read one episode of the comic every day and if you don\u2019t want to wait a day for the next episode, you can unlock it with coins. You have to use actual money to buy coins and I, for one, am broke as hell. I just want to read old comics without having to wait a day to read one episode only. Or pay for it.","418":"I have just got WEBTOON recently and already I am in LOVE with this app!! When you find a story that you REALLY love you won\u2019t be able to stay off this app!! The artists work so hard and are amazing at what they do!! I want to say to the artists thank you for such a wonderful experience. For new comers to this app I would recommend the two story \u201cLore Olympus\u201d and \u201cSiren\u2019s Lament\u201d both of these stories are well drawn and written. I would like should out to both the artists who created these AMAZING pieces or artwork, THANK YOU, thank you for such a wonderful experience with this great app!! Again thanks to the writers and artists, keep up the great works everyone!!","419":"Everything about this app is amazing except for one thing I don\u2019t understand. Free coins get deleted after a time. Why is that necessary? I was saving those for a series finale only to discover they\u2019d been expired weeks ago. I had no notification that this happened and I can\u2019t find anywhere that says it Would happen. It\u2019s unfair to those who actually did the challenges to get those coins only to have them just disappear. It\u2019s disappointing to be let down by an app you really like. If someone explains why they have to disappear in the first place it would be much appreciated, I don\u2019t have extra money so I can\u2019t just buy some.","420":"Hello! I\u2019ve been experiencing some troubles with this app lately. Although I really like it, this app keeps force closing on me. I\u2019ve tried restarting my phone, uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, and even changing my wifi. I even tried attempting to open it from another device, however it still continues to force close. I can\u2019t even get far enough to log into my account again, it closes as soon as I open it. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t seen any updates that are needed, but I really would like to log into my account again and read more Webtoons! Please, if you see this, tell me how to fix it, or at least whats going on with the app. Thank you for listening!","421":"okay when I got this app I read some stuff but I didn\u2019t much because most series were just starting off so I waited a month or two for more episodes and new series and it worked out well and I had lots of episodes and since then I have been OBSESSED with all the characters and amazing story lines but a week or two ago my WiFi was out on and off and after I got it fixed it stopped working completely everytime I clicked onto the app the connection wouldn\u2019t work even though my WiFi was fine and all other social media\u2019s were working no cover photos would show nothing the series wouldn\u2019t load NOTHING! So I looked at the help page and did everything they told me but I just ended up uninstalling the app because it wouldn\u2019t work not matter what I did but overall awesome app.","422":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the WEBTOONS app, and I use it everyday. I used fast pass for the first time just an hour ago and left the tab open. It does have a strict warning about piracy at the top of the episode before it\u2019s released. I turned off my phone and turned it back on an hour later to find some friends blowing up my phone, so I took a screenshot, because why not. I type my passcode in, and I\u2019m already in the app in the episode that I used coins to access. Suddenly, I get a notification basically threatening to send me to jail because I took a screenshot of my lock screen. The episode wasn\u2019t even in the shot. So, now I\u2019m freaking the heck out. Yay.","423":"I love WEBTOON. I\u2019ve had an account for several years now and I\u2019ve always enjoyed being able to binge read stories. However, recently the \u201cdaily pass\u201d has been added to completed stories. I find it very annoying that I have to wait to read completed stories, some of which I\u2019ve already read and just want to re-read. Currently, I\u2019m trying to read BASTARD and I can only read 2 episodes a day. That\u2019s pretty insane and stupid, if you ask me. If anything, there should AT LEAST be an option to watch an ad to get access to the episodes. I personally believe daily passes should be removed altogether. Very frustrated with this new addition as I just want to binge read a series throughout the night. Please, WEBTOON, take out this feature.","424":"Many of these authors had already gone through the completion of these stories over YEARS they wrote these with time they spent and it\u2019s unfair for the audience who followed them or new ones who are interested in reading to get this completely taken away from them. This is what causes many people to turn away from apps and to further look for illegal formats because of reasons like these having to wait for this time period when stories are already completed! That was what made webtoon so popular was that this wasn\u2019t an issue for many of their longtime favorite stories and I believe it\u2019s completely unfair to the consumer to have that taken away from them. We should be allowed to read these completed stories without ANY \u2018DAILY PASSES.\u2019  I\u2019m really upset with this app and I can\u2019t believe you guys implemented this idea. Garbage.","425":"I had such a great time reading no scope and unordinary and dice and the gamer then the new update came. It took all my reading progress and trashed it now I don\u2019t have any clue where I was, all because I got a new phone and wasn\u2019t on for a couple weeks. I would\u2019ve rated this app 5 stars because honestly it was my favorite time when I got to read these comics. But it slowly started going downhill after I first got it. It wouldn\u2019t let me sign in after it REPEATEDLY signed me out then after like a year I went back and all of a sudden it let me back on. Then it started unsubscribing me from the comics, and boy was that trouble, since I was reading like 15 at once. Then they somehow fixed everything for like a month. And of course they updated then I lost everything except I was able to log in without issue.","426":"The whole coin thing made it completely downgrade\ud83d\ude12 I mean I like the content \ud83d\ude04but I would never pay anything for comics that I read on online pages\ud83e\uddd0that don\u2019t cost a dime\ud83d\udc4fWill delete this app\ud83d\ude2dif they don\u2019t get rid of that policy and that\u2019s a bummer cause I actually like some of the comics\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4e Just get rid of the coin & waiting policy \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4fnot keeping the app if you\u2019re going to downgrade it\ud83d\ude16and make it toxic\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37 snoozing over this app if it does keep this \ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude34 i don\u2019t suggest getting this app if you don\u2019t wanna pay for content you can get from other recourses\ud83d\ude2c but if Itdoes change the policy\ud83d\ude3aI\u2019d heavily encourage\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude4cyou to download it cause it\u2019s comics of all kinds in one place \ud83d\ude0a but if it doesn\u2019t change then just don\u2019t \u2620\ufe0f","427":"Being able to read so many amazing webcomics for free is amazing, but the new \u201cDaily Pass\u201d feature is stupid. Fast Pass is great because you have the option to read ahead, but Daily Pass just makes you wait for updates on comics that are already completed, and it\u2019s a ridiculous, blatant money trap. They\u2019re completed, for Pete\u2019s sake.\n\nAlso, to anyone who\u2019s confused about waiting for episodes: the comics are actively being created by real people unless they are completed. Webtoon is not withholding episodes from you.\n\nAlso: please be aware that Fast Pass is completely optional. All webtoons are free to read, regardless of whether they have Daily Pass or Fast Pass. Daily Pass is also only for completed webtoons, but that makes it worse in a way.","428":"I have used WEBTOON for a couple years now and was ecstatic when they started the coins system but about a month ago they had a bug that made you have to resign in and reassign your device which resets your coins since coins are for that device and when I sent them an email explaining exactly what happened and that I\u2019d like the coins back that I had purchased a week prior they state this will take a while we are having trouble figuring out the cause of your issue -_- I\u2019m certain others had this issue there has been a total of 6 emails sent to them just requesting my coins I spent $30 every month and a half this is just disappointing if you want to support a creator use patreon don\u2019t use coins it\u2019s obvious LINE only cares about money. If this issue is fixed I\u2019ll take down the review and write a nicer one but this is just stupid","429":"Before I used to love webtoon it\u2019s legit the only app that was fair and I honestly was kinda annoyed to have to wait a week for the next chapter but didn\u2019t complain cuz I know how hard the authors work.\nBut with the completed webtoons u have to use a daily pass to read them and it has never opened a new chapter everyday it\u2019s always the first few episodes and that\u2019s it which is rlly unfair because they said one free episode everyday but everyday it\u2019s the same thing which I don\u2019t like so Webtoon I hope u fix this problem so that the completed series we can read in piece and don\u2019t have to worry about cliffhangers or the story cutting short because now whenever it does that I go on another manga app and I\u2019m barely using webtoon anymore.","430":"ok first off let me say that i am NOT the kind of person that likes anime and reading and stuff like that but literally this app is just so freaking amazing it blows my mind and there\u2019s absolutely no problems with it too, the stories are amazing i literally stay up until 3AM every night because i just can\u2019t get enough of these stories and i never fangirl over fictional characters but bro this hits home it slapssss i love this app so much and you can even make your own stories too, i l could  go i and on and ONNN about thus app but i\u2019ll stop now before it\u2019s a huge paragraph \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02but yeah hugely recommend because it got a person like me hooked","431":"I\u2019ve been webtoon for about 3 or 4 years now, and I absolutely LOVED it. it was an app where you could read hundreds of comics for totally free and support the artists at the same time, instead of reading off of illegal websites. When fastpass was added, I was a little taken aback because I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s favorite thing about this app was that it was totally free, but I didn\u2019t mind too much because it was in fact optional, and everything else stayed the same. However, this daily pass thing is going way too far. Having to pay to read finished webtoons just doesn\u2019t seem right. I love going back and just bingereading my favorite completed comics, but now I can only read 2 chapters per day, or else I have to pay? you\u2019ve changed, webtoon ):","432":"I don\u2019t know what had happened to everything. Today I was going to use the app but for some reason, it logged me out. What I usually did, I logged back in but all of my data besides my recents all disappeared. My comments, favorites (the ones you bookmark), everything. I went back to favorite everything back but even my the episodes I liked were gone. The only thing that was left where the recents (comics you read) and that you read the episodes and that was it. What happened? It happens every single time at least 3 times every year when I take so much time on something and it all just disappears like some magic. Did someone hack into my account or something? Luckily, I was in a good mood and didn\u2019t delete the app like I always did when these things happen.","433":"I\u2019ve been using this app for about more than half a year now and recommended it to practically every person i talked to. The app itself is great for new creators and readers who want to get away from the big companies (or just read great stories for free) but the new update is a bit of a hassle. While reading Webtoons I just got the newest update installed and was confused on why the screen wouldn\u2019t move down to read faster. So I had to scroll down stopping if I over scrolled or keep my finger on the screen, obstructing my view. Though this is a minor complaint it just throws me off so much while reading. Please bring back the one touch movement and my review will go up back to a 5.","434":"Webtoon has been so great!! So many talented authors and artists that finally have a well made platform for them to show off their hard work. 10\/10 stories on this app that keep me excited for every update. Shout out to the authors of My Dear Cold-Blooded King, Sirens Lament, I Love Yoo, Let\u2019s Play, Refund High School, SubZero, and so many more!!!! Also, shout out to the Webtoon creators because this app allows these stories to reach a large audience for FREE!!! I don\u2019t have to pay a dime unlike other apps, but I wouldn\u2019t mind to spend money helping these wonderful story tellers to continue on. Would definitely recommend this app to anyone who enjoys comic\/manga\/toon type reading!","435":"Webtoon. Please stop. I'm begging you. I don't want to participate and earn coins. If your marketing strategy is to interrupt every single update I read, you do know it makes me NOT want to read. It doesn't even let me finish reading the chapter on long updates, it sees the end and typically the most interesting part, and before I can even enjoy the flow of the story getting to its end, \"Congratulations you have read 10\/10 for the day and have earned a coin.\" Do you think I read as little as 10 updates per day? You are sorely mistaken and underestimating your readers. I would like to read in peace, so can you kindly stop shoving marketing down my throat?!","436":"When I try to log into and make a webtoon account, it says the email I am using had \"already been used.\" I just downloaded webtoon so this was really confusing to me. For instance, when I hit the create an account button, I type in my email and password,put in a user name, and retype my password and when I click next. Then it has written on the screen that I had already used the email. This might be because I tried to us the email and won't let me use it even though I still don't have an account. I do not have another email so I cannot make an actual account. This is a downside because I cannot subscribe or do anything special on Webtoon. I am not too happy about this factor of webtoon but the comics are pretty nice - just some of them are not child appropriate.  Overall, I am disappointed about creating an account but do enjoy the comics.","437":"I love reading webtoons. And I\u2019ve been reading it since it first came out, but now they added new features which I really don\u2019t like. First of all, now you gotta buy coins to read a few more episodes of a series. In the old version you could read all of them with out paying. Another things is you have to wait for a daily pass, or buy episodes to some completed series. In the old version you could read any completed series without paying. Now everyone has to wait or pay money, and I know a lot of kids who like to read webtoons but can\u2019t pay for the episodes.\nSo to any new people to this app, read series that are still in the process of being made. Honestly it\u2019s not worth it to spend money on episode.","438":"Nothing very wrong w the app, it works well and I love some comics on there! There are a couple things I think would be nice additions, if you\u2019ll consider them.\nFirstly I think it would benefit to have a way to report comments for spoilers, specifically. I don\u2019t want to report one, and y\u2019all expect to see some messed up thing. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people spoil things in the comments of some, like tower of god, and it\u2019s annoying. One kind of spoiled a twist in one webtoon :\/ \n\nSecondly is a reload button- I know it shows it for individual frames (?) when they didn\u2019t load, but I think it\u2019d be cool to have one for the whole episode- my internet isn\u2019t great and it wouldn\u2019t reload when I closed the episode\/reopened it, so I was stuck with a blank thing for a bit there (for some reason that time no reload buttons showed)\n\nThat\u2019s all I think! I haven\u2019t run into any daily pass things for completed webtoons yet, but please know that I specifically use webtoon bc it doesn\u2019t have those,, they ruin it for me usually. That note was based on another review from idk when,,","439":"I never write reviews, but I felt like I needed to for this app. In my experience, this app is rly good for any genre of comics-horror, comedy, drama, romance, and even more. There\u2019s a lot of great ones that have suspense & action, they aren\u2019t cliche love stories. *ahem, cough, cough Episode interactive* and, also, to make it even better? You can download any WEBTOON so without wifi, you can read them anytime! Many comics have valuable lessons about bullying, disorders, & more and it often turns out great- such amazing comics. This has to be the BEST comic book app out there, and thank you sm for whoever\u2019s taking the time to read this reviewwww! My personal favs are \u201ctrue beauty\u201d and \u201cI LOVE YOO.\u201d Have a great dayyyy!! ^~^ \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd","440":"I love the app you have developed. I love the idea that creators can now go out to put their creativeness out to the rest of the world, and their ability to write amazing stories. However, the latest policy update has forced many of my favorite comics, and artists to move on because of the update. Now i understand their is a younger audience that uses the app, but i feel like their should\u2019ve been a different way to fix it. You\u2019ve cut off a large audience from viewing their favorite comics. And they will just move on to a different app if it isn\u2019t addressed. So in my personal opinion it should\u2019ve been handled differently.  Thank you developers if you read my review and for your time.","441":"I love the app. Love it. The stories are cool and new and the artists are funny and interactive with their audiences. The only thing I hate is that every time I log into the app, it logs me out of the line account which has all my saved subscribed stories. So I can\u2019t like any of the stories or chapters or even see what my subscribed stories are. I just get to read that last thee-four stories I have been reading. \nThen every time I try to log in, it says that my log in information is incorrect. It may be bc I haven\u2019t had to put it in in a while and I\u2019ve gotten so fed up with having to reinstall line to fix it that I\u2019ve given up. \nIt\u2019s quiet annoying.\nSo annoying I\u2019m writing a review which I don\u2019t usually do.","442":"I love WEBTOON so much and that I can read comics from amazing people that put their heart and soul into them. I love all the different genres and the discovery page, where others can get noticed even though they aren\u2019t on the main page. But a recent policy has been added that I (and many other readers) have not been so happy about. I understand there might be kids on webtoon, but I highly doubt that most of the viewers are below 10. Yea it\u2019s mature. I understand that, but a lot of comics that I have been reading have stopped the comic because of the new policy. They are afraid that their comic would be taken down due to this. Other than that, I love the app and defiantly recommend it!","443":"I love WEBTOON. It is an amazing app. I have had it for a year now. It\u2019s reliable and one of the only comic apps that don\u2019t make you pay for the episodes of said comics. The only problem I find is the new policies that the creators of the app installed. Most of the authors I am subscribed to had to delete or take parts of an episode out. Even the comics that censor already, have to get rid of some scenes, even though nothing could be seen to begin with. The authors work really hard to give content that their viewers can enjoy. As an armature writer myself I understand a little of what they go through to make their readers happy. Even if it is scenes that some people look down on. Other than the new policies  WEBTOON is my favorite app in the App Store and I will continue to use it.","444":"In the Beginning I loved WEBTOONS! It was a way for me to read comics for free, seeing different types of art styles. But until recently WEBTOON is putting or has already put a new policy on WEBTOON not only does it upset me but upsets the audience and it frustrates the authors. It\u2019s not our fault that kids 9 and younger are reading mature content. They decide to read it, and some get report the mature content, and yet they are the ones who decided to open it in the first place. And they can\u2019t make an excuse saying that the comic didn\u2019t warn them because the author warns the audience that there will be mature content. Not only that but the authors have worked so hard making these comics for their audiences everyday and you\u2019re just gonna take down their hard work?! Like put yourself in their shoes, can you just understand for a few seconds on how frustrated they must be.","445":"I totally understand locking new chapters behind a pay wall but for completed webtoons too?? It just becomes frustrating and discouraging to read my old favorites. It does not make me want to pay. In fact, I read less webtoons in general now. I used to read so much when I had the freedom to skip around chapters without worrying if spending my coins would be worth it or not. You end up thinking that \u201cwell I already know what happens, I shouldn\u2019t be spending money again and again to reread.\u201d I don\u2019t even know if the coins will help the author. I think the paywall and daily limit on completed stories is off putting and an unwise business move. The daily limit works against the flow of chapters and is annoying! I feel bad that great stories aren\u2019t being read again and again.","446":"I was using WEBTOON like 2 hours ago and it was totally fine, but now every time I try to open it, it just won\u2019t work. It opens with the WEBTOON logo like normal then the screen turns black real quick and I end up on my home screen again. I\u2019ve tried opening the app on two different devices and it won\u2019t work on either. So I need to know if it\u2019s my account or the app itself. I\u2019ve tried everything I could think of and I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I still love WEBTOON though and that\u2019s why I gave it 5 stars. I\u2019m gonna try to use it in the morning and if it works, great, if it doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t what I\u2019m gonna do with my life.","447":"Okay, so to start off with the bad stuff. This is a really good app but why do u do fast passes. Like it doesn\u2019t make any cents I would like to know why \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd2d. Another bad thing is webtoons people need to take a chill pill. Because when creators do anything cool on about her site and share it on there comic webtoon gives them warnings.  Another things about the chill pill is when a created dose a little bad content it get delisted. I know for some young readers it\u2019s bad but I Don\u2019t agree. So if the creater is gonna read this just HELP the app. But it is a good app. So now for all the GOOD things. This is the the best app ever . It has stuff to make you cry stuff to make you feel weird and stuff to give you bad dreams. So I love this app I\u2019m not gonna keep on typing telling you all the good stuff \ud83d\ude1d . So \u2b06\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f","448":"I used to love the app, and I have no complaints about daily passes, bc honestly I just have to wait for normal updates... Whatever. But the lagging has been getting worse. I'll agree with a comment, and it won't load or update my thumbs up until I leave the episode, or take back the agreement. Often times, my daily updates don't load, and I'll click the \"subscribed\" tab to see them... But recently, even that stopped loading. Is the server overloaded or something? It's getting really annoying, and I don't want to have to stop reading them just bc I'm frustrated with the app. I've had to go onto safari to read them at this point, but it's just so not worth the hassle after a while... PLEASE FIX THE BUGS thank you :))))","449":"Let me just say\u2014don\u2019t download this app if you have limited free time\/have tests upcoming lol. It\u2019s a lot of fun and I\u2019ve found some super awesome stories I\u2019ve really enjoyed! Sadly a lot of writers don\u2019t tag for violence or mature themes which doesn\u2019t affect my view of the app, just wanted to mention it to prospective users to be careful if they\u2019re sensitive to certain themes. \nBut lately, within the past few days, I\u2019m having issues with ads randomly becoming full screen while reading chapters. Please fix this since the ads we see just by regular scrolling are visible enough and these seem to be glitchy.","450":"Not many people are happy with this, I\u2019m not happy either. This would have been a five star if it weren\u2019t for the new policy. Many of my favorite authors have even braced the idea of going to another site, and so have I, I want to enjoy my comics for what they are without anyone telling me that its content is going to change. I would think that many others have also thought about moving to another site to read their favorite Authors content. The thing is that Webtoon allows you to read them for free unlike many other sites. But in all honesty I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair. Not to the authors at least. They have worked very hard on their comics and have enjoyed being with the awesome community there. I love WEBTOON and I might stay for the comics that don\u2019t have to worry about the new policy but for the rest of my favorite ones I might just go looking somewhere else.","451":"First, this app is amazing, and I love the platform! I\u2019ve been reading Webtoons for almost 3 years now, and am subscribed to wayyyy too many amazing stories. I would definitely recommend downloading. \nThere\u2019s already a lot of comments about Daily Pass so I\u2019ll skip over that, but I am also very upset with it. \nOne suggestion I have for the app is making friends! I have a few friends that also use Webtoon, and it would be an awesome feature if we could \u201cadd\u201d each other to see what we all are reading, and make suggest stories that we love! To add onto that, a list making feature where you could save your favorite Webtoons would be appreciated.  Thank you!","452":"My friend got this app one day and talked about it all the time. And when I say all the time, i mean literally all the time. She said how amazing this reading app is. And at the time I hated reading. So I said that she should stop and how I bet the app is stupid. Fast forward a few months to a year, I have nothing to do so I asked her what I should do. She said to get the app. So I did because I was that bored. Ever since I got it I was obsessed! It is the best app ever. There is so many comics to read and all of them are really good. It\u2019s been almost 3 years now and I\u2019ve never got bored of the app. Thank you to that friend for introducing me to the best app ever.","453":"I have read some of my favorite comics at least 7 times, maybe more. But now I have to use daily passes to read them over again. It seems a little tedious to do, because I would rather read them all at the same time and enjoy them over again. I\u2019m not saying I hate the app, I actually want to become a webtoon artist one day, but this seems like too much. I hope we don\u2019t have to use daily passes in the future though. I\u2019m sure a lot of fans of original comics are very upset to have to either use coins or use passes. So please consider changing this feature, so new readers and old readers can enjoy the comics. Because I think all of them are great. :)","454":"First off, I love this app.  I spend most of my day reading these webcomics and I get so invested in them, but there is this new implication that is quite irritating.  When some of the canvas episodes update they have an ad on them, but everytime I go to click the ad it says something along the lines of \u201cCannot load the Reward Ad\u201d My internet is perfectly fine, and this problem has been happening for days.  I\u2019m okay with having ads, it supports the creators, and I really enjoy this one ad that when you click it, it\u2019ll take you to a new story to read, but I\u2019m afraid to click it because it\u2019ll make me rewatch the ad which probably won\u2019t even load.","455":"I\u2019m very much enjoying WEBTOON. It\u2019s easy to use, easy to understand, and bug free. I highly recommend it. \n\nHowever, there are a few things changes I would love , predominantly in the comment section beneath chapters. \n\nFirstly, I think the app would be improved by being able to change back and forth between \ud83d\udc4d and \ud83d\udc4e on comments. I have accidentally thumbed down comments, and being unable to change it is disheartening.  Also, since the comments can be edited after they\u2019re posted (a feature I love) it makes sense that the \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e should be able to be changed too. \n\nSecondly, It would be nice if there was a shortcut to view comments you personally made, or the threads that you\u2019re apart of. Currently, you have to sift back though every comment that was made to find it yours. \n\nLastly, it would be nice to have the option to be notified when a \ud83d\udc4d was made on your comment. \n\nAll in all, Amazing App, Spectacular stories (thank you creators) but I wish there was a better interface for the reading community to chat with one another.","456":"I\u2019ve had this app for over two years now and not once have I deleted it. I open it up every day and I find quality content that makes me smile\/laugh\/cry\/angry\/excited and more. All for free. I have not had to pay a dime to read any of the content on this app- and for me that\u2019s a diamond in the rough. I read over 40 comics now and it is so easy to navigate the app once you find the comics that interest you. The creators are so interactive and engaging with us, you can speak directly to them through the comments at the end of each chapter posted on each story. This app is going to be a permanent one in my storage.","457":"I downloaded this app because I was hoping for a better mobile experience. Unfortunately the app doesn\u2019t seem to be any different, and actually worse for the iPhone X line since the tops of comics are cut off by the tab.\n\nTo see the top you need to pull the page down and when you let go the page springs back up and brings up the black control bars. The control bars themselves feel like a weird UX element for a native app, and they mostly annoy me. Maybe I\u2019m only noticing the bad, but it seems like they come up when I don\u2019t want them, and don\u2019t always come up when I want to see them.\n\nApp is probably useful if you need offline access, but otherwise just use the mobile site.","458":"The reason i say its a must have its because its just reading, I\u2019ve loved reading for the past 2 years now I was never into its until 2 years ago, my friend introduced me to Line WEBTOON and i actually enjoyed it. These a genre for everyone I\u2019ve had friendly and funny debates about which webtoon was good or bad in our opinions. But the main reason is that its just fun to wake up or before you go to sleep to read a comic thats so easy to access, during work, school breaks, etc. However, i do wish for a night mode as turning my screen on to go to webtoon which has a primarily white UI tends to hurt my eyes. But aside from that 5 Stars.","459":"For the most part, the app is ok. But I\u2019m starting to see some really frustrating issues with Webtoons. One, is the comment filter which is starting to aggravate me. I could write a simple comment that has no expletive language, or anything particularly harmful...All PG with a bit of euphemism. But the comment filter would just harass me with a comment until I give up. For example:\n\n\u201dHm, I think she should have told him about her makeup.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t post a comment like that because something there triggered the filter, and I have no clue why. Can the creators bother to add some guidelines of what words trigger this and better yet, can this get fixed because this is extremely aggravating even if you want to leave a constructive review. I gave this app 2 stars for the filter system alone.","460":"Alright... so, imma TRY to make this quick lol.\n\nBasically..... the webtoons are pretty good, and my favorite is definitely Mage & Demon Queen... but, I find it very hard to find other webtoons that I like. For me, the main problems are: \n\n1.) The genres are very limited. It seems you can only choose one. Also, there is a lack of picking gl(girl love) and bl(boy love)... I personally wish those were options in the genres. Unless there is, and I don\u2019t see it? But I doubt it.\n\n2.) Webtoon picking lags... meaning, when I wish to make em list the webtoons by stars or popularity or date, it messes around and has blanks everywhere in the list. \n\n3.) Faster way of liking Webtoon chapters... so, I know this might seem minor, but I definitely think there should be a way to like all the chapters faster or something lol.\n\n4.) This is my personal opinion, and it\u2019s not really a problem lol. Just a belief.... Heartblood (a webtoon comic) should definitely be featured because it\u2019s so amazing, and I def. recommend to anyone!\n\nAaanywho, don\u2019t mind me. But, aside from those, the webtoon app is alright... could be better though! Thanks:)","461":"This app is great and I\u2019ve been using it for over a year. There\u2019s been a lot of really great web comics that I\u2019ve binged and fell in love with and it feels very creator friendly. \n\nHowever 2 things have popped up for the past week and those are that theres a bug where it logs you out randomly and then asks you to login again, but if you close the app and open again then it doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem until it logs you back out -_-\nThe other thing is that I didn\u2019t see anything in the app to where I could report anything like this to ask for a change which is why I came to the AppStore to complain.","462":"WEBTOON has started to make people buy coins to progress through certain comics. Now I don\u2019t mind paying a subscription if I enjoy an app or donating to deserving patreons. What I DO mind is when a comic charges me PER PAGE to read a comic. It is five coins per page(!) to read ghost wife on here or wait well over a week to read each page for a comic that updates twice a week. You get 10 coins for a dollar so it\u2019s  1 dollar every week to read this comic ALONE. Imagine how quickly it would add up if you read as many as 20 or thirty a week like I do. For right now ghost wife is the only comic I have found that charges. If they all start I will simply find another app. If this becomes like tappytoon I will leave 1 star as a rating. \nThanks for reading.","463":"I have read thousands of comics from webtoons and they might be weird but I am happy they are their to fill my reading gap. I hate reading but these make me feel happy and when I start to see they have to stop or they have to change their content because of new rules and policies. It makes me sad because they are doing what they love and I love this app but new policy are making people change their books and new books with guide lines isn\u2019t how it should be it should be art with no guidelines of course nudes can be blurred but not so hard on the creators they have a hard hobby as is I hope this gets to one of the head people to maybe change policy or something I don\u2019t want to read boring books that don\u2019t interest me...","464":"One of my absolute favorite series ending a little while ago and every so often I like to come back to it and reread it. I\u2019ve been reading it for four years now and it\u2019s helped me through some rough times in my life. But now that I\u2019m having to pay to reread my favorite chapters, it makes me want to have nothing to do with it at all. I understand that it\u2019s important to support the artists, but for people with financial issues and for those who aren\u2019t even old enough to be employed at all, Dailypass is an extreme inconvenience for people who simply enjoy reading. There have to be other ways to support our favorite artists without paying a lot of money just to reread their chapters. Please find an alternative way or get rid of Dailypass altogether.","465":"Webtoon is great for discovering new stories to pass the time. The content you can find here is diverse and it holds your attention when you find a story you like. BUT daily pass is lowering the enjoyment for a lot of people. Stories that were completely free and easy to binge watch are now under daily pass, and instead of speed reading the story because you can't get enough of it you now have to either wait a day just to read 1-2 episodes or you have to pay for every single episode of each daily pass story you don't want to wait for. supporting the authors and getting scammed are two very different things, but it feels like webtoon is trying to convince you they're the same","466":"I love Webtoons! There are so many different types of things to read with amazing artwork and even music for some! The only reason I didn\u2019t give it five stars is because lately I have not been able to participate in the challenges to win free coins. I don\u2019t have the means to buy coins to fast pass and get to read some of my favorites early so I love the contests! Every time I open the contest page it takes me out of the app totally. If this gets fixed I Iwill be back to rate 5 stars! Please fix it! After my phone updated and I deleted the app and reinstalled it works perfectly! 5 stars it is!","467":"WEBTOON is a great app I love it, I love reading the comics on there, they are great. One problem and this is the reason it\u2019s three stars instead of five, so now to there is an option to watch the latest episode with an add, and when I go to click it, it says unable to load reward ad. Try again later. So I do and it just says the same thing I\u2019ve been waiting for a week and it doesn\u2019t work the only comic it does that is My Gentle Giant, and it was happening to My Awkward Magic but when I updated the app it stopped. I have no problem watching an ad, and I\u2019ve contacted the creators they said they did speak with webtoon but if it\u2019s keeps happening talk to you guys, its a big inconvenience for . And I\u2019d like to know why it\u2019s specifically happening to me.","468":"I had no problem for several months, until somebody else had accessed my account, downloaded several webtoons, and then attempted to log into my email. I changed my password and that appeared to be the end of it, until today when I received a notification that somebody had \"unfollowed me.\" Thinking that this was strange because I didn't think you could follow people on WEBTOON, I clicked on the notification and was immediately brought to the app's homepage. This leads me to believe that somebody had attempted to access my account once again. It doesn't seem that anyone else is having this problem; however, this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately. This app's security should not be so fragile that random people can send me notifications or access my account.","469":"So I\u2019ve had this app for over a year now, and I love it. Almost all of the authors are really engaged with their audience and the comics are (for the most part) well written and beautifully drawn. I enjoy getting regular updates on the comics as well. However, I was that there was a way to gift people coins. Like, if you have a friend that uses the app, I wish there was a way to give them \u201cx\u201d amount of coins that I purchased. That\u2019s probably pretty hard to program, so I doubt it\u2019ll happen anytime soon, but I think it would be really great and make a great improvement to the atmosphere on webtoon.","470":"I absolutely love this app! I love reading the amazing stories and looking at the really cool art. I can\u2019t believe an app like this exist. But... I can\u2019t help but be sad that there isn\u2019t enough comics for me personally. I also wish some artist would post more often (yet I do understand they are doing this using their spare time and may be busy). I used to read this really good comic about that teenager with the really crazy dad that tortured girls or whatever and the boy falls in love with this one girl so he protects her. But it got deleted! I think this app deserves many more authors and readers! I live to read these comments so keep up the good work!","471":"I\u2019ve had Line Webtoon since 2014 (back when the logo was bubbly instead of geometrical) and I absolutely love this app. I love all the stories and that creators can express themselves. Recently, however, every time I get to the end of an ep., my app just glitches with a black screen and then gets out. This has been happening for the past two weeks and it\u2019s starting to really get on my nerves. Webtoon, please fix this, I want to be able to binge read without problems. ):\nP. S. Don\u2019t let this comment hinder you from downloading Webtoon and transporting yourself into the wonderful worlds that are created for us. \ud83d\udc9c","472":"No one likes daily pass. It\u2019s also definitely making it less likely for me to read some webtoons. I spend a decent amount of money on webtoons and enjoy supporting authors and the app, but for the already completed stories it is disappointing. For one thing, I am already spending money on the ongoing stories. For another, I think there are other ways to get money from completed stories. You could place an ad every few chapters, or create a way for people to donate through the app. Even start advertising merch more!!! But everyone is highly disappointed by the addition of daily pass so I hope that you consider other options.","473":"Is it too much to ask to get landscape view support? I\u2019ve used this app for a while on my phone and recently got a new iPad. The app itself will not switch to landscape when browsing the main menu at all. When reading it will switch if your auto-rotate is enabled and its being held sideways. HOWEVER, as soon as you load the next chapter even if your device is laying horizontally and has not changed positions it will switch back to horizontal view. Please add a feature that forces the app to stay horizontal or at least doesn\u2019t make you look like you\u2019re playing some crazy driving game when really all you want is to read a Webtoon :\/","474":"The content is great and it was my favorite reading app until recently. Adding fast basses was a cool idea that I could choose to make use of but suddenly they want you to pay for daily passes for completed series. It would be one thing if it was like that from the beginning but suddenly telling long time users they can\u2019t reread or even finish an older series unless they pay feels like a betrayal. It also hurts the completed series, less people will be willing to read them if they have to suddenly pay more. The only reason I\u2019m not giving 3 stars is because I don\u2019t want a bad business move to reflect on the great content.","475":"I love the app and it might just be because of my phone but when I try to watch a video for an episode to unlock it, it just takes me back to the home screen after having an error message. I would really love it if it could be fixed. Like I said I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just me, I could be the only one. After re-downloading it, logging in and out of my accounts, and going to Customer Care for help, nothing has worked! I could use someone\u2019s advice on what to do to handle this situation please. Thank you! (P.S. I still really love the app and will continue using it like normal for the web comics that don\u2019t require videos to unlock them.)","476":"I\u2019ve been noticing a bit lately with the app every time I use it. All the dates are completely wrong through the whole thing. It either shows people posting stuff from like six months in the future which is impossible. You can\u2019t comment on a freshly released comic and have it say you commented six months in the future. \nPlus it\u2019ll show a freshly updated comic that was like released today as it being released in 2019. Which is really hard to do since the writer posted it in 2020.\nReporting issues should be a lot easier. Would be nice if you\u2019re reporting bug issues or a bad comment that it actually lets you fill out a report. Rather then having to stare at that issue for the rest of time.","477":"I understand perfectly that creators should be paid for their content, and I think the early access is a good way to provide that. However, I cannot understand the comics suddenly releasing less frequently, shorter chapters, and the final straw SLOWLY RE-RELEASING A FINISHED COMIC. That content has been readily available up until now and it is ridiculous to suddenly put a price tag on it, very thankful I finished it before this whole fiasco. The constant promotion for the coins makes the app very distracting and makes it very hard to feel immersed in the stories these artist work very hard to tell. I hope they turn to their own publication so they can tell their stories to their audience as they intended, with their own price tags, not those imposed by an app...","478":"So for the past few years, I've been enjoying my stay in Webtoon. Honestly, I love the site and reading on it.\n\nBut recently, my phone freezes up. I can't click on anything before the app is frozen and sometimes I get stuck. It's stuff like pressing the person icon but not being able to go to subscribed, or pressing a webcomic but it taking around 10 minutes to fully load without me being able to click on any episodes.\n\nI've tried using a friends phone and downloading the app on there. It didn't work. I tried downloading it again and can't even log in anymore, and I still can't click on much. I haven't been able to read Webtoon mobile for three to four weeks. I catch up on laptop, but the formatting was meant for mobile so it's difficult to deal with.\n\nI might have to drop this app after years of using it. There may be something wrong with iPhone 7's and Webtoon, I'm not too sure, but if anyone sees this, could you please fix this bug? Thank you.","479":"Hey guys I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s been up lately, but my Webtoon app has been acting up really bad. I can load up the app, but when I go to click a story it completely freezes and I have to restart the app to be able to interact with anything. If I click from the home tab to the canvas tab it completely freezes up, and again I have to refresh. It isn\u2019t even loading up my subscribed stories, so I can\u2019t try loading them from a different page. I\u2019ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling, and restarting my phone. I\u2019m not really sure what else to do at this point, but I enjoy the stories y\u2019all provide so I\u2019d really appreciate it if this was looked into.","480":"I love this app because it provides readers with an endless flow of entertainment (for free!) and it\u2019s a great platform for artists and authors as well! I love how everyone who uses this app is supportive and polite. Not five stars because I think the app could have some improvements like the bookmark feature. It\u2019s really annoying when you are interrupted in the middle of a long chapter and when you come back to it the book mark only saves what chapter you\u2019re on, not where you are in the chapter. Also in the comments section, there\u2019s no way to go directly to the top comments to reply! Other than these two little nit picks this app is totally awesome and worth downloading!!!","481":"I really love WEBTOON. They have great comics and they\u2019re easier to read than other apps but I\u2019d love it if it were possible to earn more free coins. They have their daily check in thing right now which is cool but its only 5 coins at the end of 15 days. I\u2019m all about supporting content creators but I read tons of comics and $10 for 80 coins doesn\u2019t go far. At least with webcomics I have the option to watch a video to get a free pass. Either way you\u2019re still making money and a portion goes to creators. I just don\u2019t read WEBTOON as often anymore because of not always being able to afford $10 on coins just to get the best deal. It bums me out I\u2019ve lost touch with some of my favorite stories just because webcomics makes it easier to read their comics while still supporting creators.","482":"So, I really love this app, considering I love to read and stuff. The main reason I\u2019m writing this is because I would like to put the stories I\u2019ve finished somewhere else like an archive, or a finished tab or something. Just so it makes it more organized and less crowded on your webcomic\u2019s page. (Even though for me, it\u2019s always crowded) I like to be organized and when I finish a book, I usually go back and reread it a couple times. Idk, just something that would be nice. This is just a suggestion and it\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s just me being weird and wanting a place to put the comics I\u2019ve finished. \ud83d\ude02 Still Love it though!","483":"Don\u2019t get me wrong.  I love this app.  It\u2019s just that the new policy is ruining my interest for this app.  I understand that sexual themes are not exactly the most intellectual thing for comics, especially when there\u2019s a chance of people underage to find those type of comics.  But still... not gonna lie, the physical interaction is what started my passion for WEBTOON.  I also know that a lot of people would agree with me.  So if you keep this policy going then I know a pretty good amount of us will move on to a new comic app that actually allows that sort of stuff. Also, all you really need to do is make sure people can prove that they\u2019re 18+ when wanting to read a comic like that.  Just to make matters worse, a lot of publishers have ended their comics because of not being able to make it have a sexual theme.  So please on behalf of the people who agree, change the rules for it.","484":"I enjoy the great comics but someone needs to fix the glitches in the app. I have the latest version for IOS and after checking in every day to get 5 coins to read a comic I actually like it says I need to update to the latest version to get the free 5 coins. This is the second time I wasted my time I will never get back reading a comic I didn\u2019t enjoy just to get 5 coins I never received because of a glitch and now the pages aren\u2019t loading on mangas. This and the censorship without an option to view mature material are why I mainly use Tapas and spend money on ink I stead of WEBTOON coins. The only reason I even keep reading WEBTOON is to support the authors I like. I will never give my money to WEBTOON and once I find other sources with the comics I like I am deleting this app. It used to be good but now it is just taking up space on my phone.","485":"Webtoon\u2019s new discover policy it is really irritating. I\u2019ve always enjoyed reading comics on webtoon and supporting new artists\/writers\/creators. However, this policy poses limitations to these new authors and thus it is driving them away, some of my favorite authors have stopped uploading content.  New creators on such a large platform, even if the work they produce is astounding they don\u2019t get enough recognition on the discover page. Therefore, preventing these authors from promoting content outside of webtoon for followers to support them is not reasonable. \nAbout the policy against NSFW it interferes with the development of the comics that were intended to have such content. Authors include this for specific audiences and it\u2019s unwise to drive that audience away. There are many other ways of managing such content as opposed to restricting it all. \nThanks Byeee","486":"This app is a really amazing app, full of unique, wonderful stories. This app has many genres of stories to read, full of different and great titles. If you want a chance to create your own WEBTOON, you can publish it in Discover, and it become a WEBTOON later on. Many WEBTOON creators have their own art style that they incorporate into the stories. Some of the most beautiful stories (art-wise) include My Dear Cold-Blooded King, and Stars Wars. WEBTOONs with unique art styles include Siren's Lament, I Love Yoo, and UnOrdinary. There are even Korean comics, such as Lookism or Bastard! In conclusion, I highly recommend this app, as it provides many genres of comics, with unique and interesting plots\/art.","487":"It\u2019s incredible that the app is completely free and yet still very quality! The music chapters were an incredible idea, I\u2019m not sure who came up with that. Being able to download for later is a great, useful idea, too! An idea for making it better is making the search section more accurate, like maybe being able to choose fantasy AND romance to see what comes up, or maybe being able to choose what is at the top of the results, like most downloads, finished, updated most recently. But besides that, I have no complaints! Definitely download this app!","488":"So, have been using this app for quite a while now and I have been enjoying the heck out of it! I found so many interesting and funny comics to read! But, here\u2019s the thing: after webtoon passed their new policy I see that a lot of the series that I enjoy are having to delete some of their pages in fear of having their comic deleted due to their \u201cinappropriateness\u201d. I seriously can\u2019t enjoy the app as much anymore with all these policy\u2019s that are being passed. It would be great if these policies were repealed so that the web series I enjoy aren\u2019t having to delete all their pages! Seriously hope this problem can be fixed soon.","489":"I have enjoyed the webtoon app for years & praised it for being one the the few apps where you could read web comics without having to pay to go continue to enjoy the series. I was devastated to find out that there was going to be a daily pass for all completed webtoons. I reread so many webtoons, & it breaks my heart that i cant go & normally reread the webtoons i come back to so very often. I don\u2019t think daily pass should qualify if the person has already completed reading the series. Then what\u2019s the point? are the creators of the stories even going to get the money you\u2019re trying to take from us? I\u2019m so disappointed that you guys are doing this to users of this app. Daily passes should only be for webtoons that the user has not finished reading before, this company is being incredibly selfish","490":"Webtoon is a free app that doesn\u2019t have pop up ads and instead puts an ad at the bottom of the chapter. It\u2019s super simple to use and understand how it works and even has a mini tutorial of how the app works. It has so many stories from many authors with a wide variety of genres. Webtoon also has a fast pass system which if you want to read ahead a couple chapters, you can use coins that you can buy or earn by completing little events. For the Canvas stories, you can read ahead by watching an ad. Overall this app is amazing and simple to use. 10\/10 would recommend. \u263a\ufe0f","491":"I was genuinely thrilled when I first got WEBTOON and realized it didn\u2019t make me pay to binge read stories, I got the fast pass thing and didn\u2019t have a problem with it (since it\u2019s paying to read ahead) but the whole daily pass is destroying the whole reason I was so exited about the app. It\u2019s no better then the other comic apps, it was a good app where people could start up their career and get noticed while readers could binge the stories with no extra fee. The whole situation reminds of Wattpad which did the same thing, I stopped using Wattpad because it started forcing people to spend money to have the abilities that once were free and I really don\u2019t want to have a repeat of the whole Wattpad thing, it drove its users away.","492":"The comics are top-nautch but the app is kinda garbage. If you try to like a comment or episode the app won\u2019t register. Then you wait 5 seconds and click the like button again and it will like and unlike the comment. Quite annoying. Also whenever you touch a new series to read it starts from the most recent episode. So if you\u2019re trying to access early episodes you have to scroll down. This would be fine except that whenever you scroll down more than about 30episodes, the app takes an outrageous amount of time to load the next 30 episodes. Now imagine my frustration when trying to reach episode 14 of Tower of God which has like 400 chapters.... great comics but fix your app WEBTOON","493":"So addictive!! Has comics for everyone to enjoy. Horror, romance, mystery, action, comedy, and slice of life. You name it they have something you will like. Everything is so original. The only thing I would complain about is that there is a limit of a hundred comics that you can subscribe to. A hundred may seem like a lot until you start falling in love with all of the comics that they have to offer and you may have to make choices on what you want to stay subscribed to. Please if the creators of WEBTOON could please do something about the limit it would be the best thing ever and I would give this app 5 stars. Wish there was no limit :(","494":"I LOVE this app!! I love reading and I love mangas so when I was introduced to this app I downloaded immediately! No problems with adds or glitches! You can comment your opinion without much hate and most of the comments are pretty clean (but that depends on what you\u2019re reading of course) there are some amazing artists and story tellers on here that can show off their skills and I thing that is amazing sense I am an artist myself! I recommend this app completely (especially if you\u2019re a book\/art lover like me). Not sure what I\u2019d do without it but I can tell you I\u2019d be very bored most of the time! Don\u2019t regret downloading at all!","495":"I love the app and unordinary and tower of god are two of my favorite comics. The reason I gave it four stars is because there is a list of which have updated. That\u2019s great, so you don\u2019t have to check them individually, at first. Once you\u2019ve read a few, you lose track of which ones you haven\u2019t. To help with this, there IS a list of recents, however, they list only the ones you have read, therefore making you check recents and updated to find whichever one is not in recents to know which ones you haven\u2019t read. It would be better if there was another tab that had \u201cunread\u201d to make it easier to know which you have not checked.","496":"WEBTOON is the best comic book app ever that I owned. It has really good stories to read and inspiring drawings that the artists do. All tho I really liked the original WEBTOON app that was for iPad. It was really nice to use & read. I liked how you could read in the landscape mode and tap to read instead of scrolling. I just wish that you guys didn\u2019t remove those features from the app. Maybe in the next update you can add them back in. Because it is kind of hard to read in the portrait mode and scrolling down to read. I can see how some readers like that way to read but I just don\u2019t like it. I love WEBTOON otherwise!!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a","497":"I really love the app! Especially all the comics, like Lore Olympus and Hooky. Although, with all these great comics and such, I don\u2019t think the Daily Pass is too- good?- What I mean is, what is it\u2019s complete use? It just seems to just stop a reader from reading a finished comic. Would there be a way to allow more episodes to be read during the Daily Pass, instead of what there is given? I\u2019m pretty sure most people would agree, as not only would it give off a more continues comic feel, it would also give the reader time to understand the plot of the finished comic! \n\nAlso, is it just me, or is anyone else having trouble signing into their account?","498":"I love this app, I\u2019ve used it for over a year. It has all of these amazing comics to read from but with the new updates it\u2019s been lagging, not letting me read new comics that get updated. And especially with the new thing they\u2019ve done with some comics having to watch a video to \u201cunlock\u201d the chapter I hate that because it always says \u201cthere are no videos right now\u201d so I\u2019m behind on a couple of the comics I read.  Sometimes it makes me want to delete it but know how much I love the other ones that don\u2019t do that so I still have it. So, besides the new updates with the rewards to read  and the lagging I think that the app is pretty cool. Plz fix those reading reward things I really want to read some of my comics.","499":"I feel as though the new update to the policy is very unfair in the sense that it take a very long time to make panels and it\u2019s very dream crushing for people who enjoy making mature content mature content is not allowed in a lot of places so creators took time to blur and put age warnings just to create what they liked and it also effected the readers and a yaoi\/ BL reader I was very upset because many of my favorite creators were forced to take down content and have to change the whole direction of there comics so they had to take down Weeks! Of work and time and probably late nights and they had to do that just so the whole comic wouldn\u2019t be taken down I just wanted to say this and I hope it brings light to this situation any other day I would GLADLY give webtoon 5 stars but the new policy has angered many including me. Thank you~","500":"It\u2019s an amazing app and it\u2019s inspired me a lot honestly I don\u2019t know where I would be without the app. There is something I don\u2019t seem to be a fond of. I know it\u2019s been mentioned but I just dislike the daily pass feature. Recently I got a new phone and logged in to my webtoon account on it but it doesn\u2019t show me where I left off. This isn\u2019t a big problem for me I would just go back a few chapters. However, I have some webtoons where I\u2019m not even close to finishing and don\u2019t know where I left off, like Cheese in a Trap, and I have to count on my luck to land on the chapter I left off before I try again tomorrow. I\u2019m sorry but I dislike daily feature.","501":"Honestly Webtoon is a great app and still is to others. I loved the hard work and creativity authors put into their comics and how amazing they where. I\u2019d be so happy for the updates. But now I just figured out about the new policy that\u2019s going on. People who have amazing comics that may have mature content in it are starting to want to give up on Webtoon. Because of this new policy a lot of books I and others read are going to be taken down. Story\u2019s that may have be a mature content in them aren\u2019t only about sex. Some are also comedy\u2019s, mystery\u2019s, dramas, fantasy\u2019s and so much more. Sex isn\u2019t the main topic on some and most comics. It breaks my heart to see a lot to the comics I love will mess up and the whole story will have to change.","502":"I USED to enjoy WebToons before I realized how greedy they are. I had once earned coins once before because I enjoyed the comic they were showing. Same here. \nYour Throne was one I have been keeping track of for a long time and am up to date on. I also started reading The Remarried Empress and was enjoying it so far. I had JUST ONE  page left to read; the advertisement for the Royalty free coin thing was UP. I read the full episode and when I got to the end, it didn\u2019t show my coins. I then noticed my internet had cut off and now to my surprise, the free coin thing doesn\u2019t show up anymore! What kind of scheme is Webtoons playing at? I read everything as quickly as possible, and on the day they release the last episode I needed, the deal is GONE? Seriously, do I need to SPEND coins just to get coins? That\u2019s some shady ****!","503":"I believe that the many comics on webtoon are amazing, and the ability for anyone to post via canvas allows me to find rare gems. However, the app itself needs work. This is annoying because it didn\u2019t not too long ago. With the new update, the app has been moving as slow as molasses, making me have to wait quite a while when going from one webtoon to another. This is especially annoying because now with the new update it drains battery at unhealthy speeds and heats my phone up a lot to. I don\u2019t know what you guys did but it\u2019s been really annoying and I hope you guys fix it. Other than that, the app is great.","504":"I love the app!! And of course I love the stories. The only thing that bothers me is the comments section while you click on my, which is at the bottom. I write so my comments that there is arrow so then I can go to the next page but when I click on it, it doesn\u2019t let me. I try to click the arrows on the comments section for each story and it works fine. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just for my account or if it\u2019s happening to everyone, but it just bothers me because then I won\u2019t be able to see how many thumbs up I got for my comments. Other than that, it\u2019s fine. I love WEBTOON and reading different stories everyday.","505":"Webtoon is a great app, all the comics on there are interesting to read and I use it quite often. But an issue has been happening, and it\u2019s very frustrating. This issue is the ad situation. Webtoon added a feature where you can watch an add to unlock an episode on Canvas. Now, this is a really good idea, except for the fact that it doesn\u2019t work for many people. The ad won\u2019t load, or people are just dealing with issues with it in general. The ad idea is great because it helps support the authors of Canvas comics and helps them get a bit of revenue, but if it isn\u2019t working for some people, it\u2019s not going to be useful. Please try to fix this issue.","506":"I think Webtoon is really cool and I read comics from it daily. There\u2019s lots of great user generated content and I love that creators can have direct feedback from readers via comments. The user interface is also very simple to use. The one thing that I think would be awesome is if Webtoon had a branch for posting light novels. For English authors, there aren\u2019t great platforms for submitting light novels to a western audience. I think it would be really cool if webtoon had a branch that was similar to Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d in Japan. Considering the growing popularity of Webtoon, I think it would be really cool to see something like this.","507":"I literally loved this app so much but with the daily pass it makes it harder to read completed content. It takes months to read the completed stuff, and some I actually waited it to be completed but now I can only access it with a daily pass. Also with the daily pass it only unlocks the episodes for 14 days, and I have to go and unlock everyday to make sure I can get the daily pass episodes for the day, but it\u2019s hard with work and school if I miss it that day. Also some series have so many episodes so it would takes months to finish with daily pass if I don\u2019t pay for it. Idk it just makes me really sad because the nice thing about webtoon was that it was free but a lot of series aren\u2019t anymore, even recently completed ones. :(","508":"Honestly this is the app that is most used on my phone, and has made my boredom vanish, I would definitely recommend!!\n\nHowever, the new WEBTOON policy has really gotten rid of the most important parts in some of my favorite comics... I understand the need to put it in place, because some kids may be on the app, but erasing an artists hard work because it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d just isn\u2019t fair to the artist. If there\u2019s a notification asking if you\u2019re 18 and up, it\u2019s the kids fault if they lie, and the artist shouldn\u2019t have to take down their work because of it. WEBTOON if you see this, please take down that dumb policy, it has gone too far. I still love this app","509":"I\u2019ve had this app for quite a while, but only since these couple of days, I\u2019ve been opening the app only to see internet connection error and a button to retry - which does nothing. It\u2019s frustrating for me when I want to keep up-to-date with my comics. I tried resetting my internet settings, but it did nothing. Usually this occurs for a couple of days then goes away. Right now, I have the problem happening as of now. My friend doesn\u2019t seem to have the problem, which is odd since she has the same phone as me. I hope there will be an update to fix this problem!","510":"I love this app but i wish there were more stores that are like a girl or brother and sister being tested on or in a lad or something like that if your in to that stuff there is not a lot of that any ways I\u2019m in to that stuff and I like it but you have to ether make an account or not have coins to read some episodes but other then that I say it is good but can there be les kissy or romantic stuff if your in to that kind of stuff there is a lot if that stuff but any ways I think it is a really good app but if your under 10 then you probably should not have it any ways I like this app you should deal get this app but not if your under ten","511":"I love this app so much! I\u2019ve been playing it for about a year or so, and I\u2019m never getting old of it. The one thing I don\u2019t really like is when you sign in it says \u2018read free comics!\u2019 Something like that, but at certain points, you have to get coins. And in order to get coins, it\u2019s money. I was reading \u2018Save Me\u2019 the BTS on the other day and, I needed coins to get in to the next point. When that happens, I usually just leave it on hold and go to other comics. I\u2019ve now bought some coins but, if your interested in getting this app, it\u2019s amazing one, and you need to buy coins two. But I really love the app btw! \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f","512":"I love the creativity and the content that is shown on the app, but it has just become somewhere for people to spend all of their money reading. You have to either buy a fast pass or only read one episode a day once you get to a certain point. It is very annoying, and there are other sites to read on that you don\u2019t need to spend money on. If the content was physical I would buy it, but I\u2019m not buying a pass to read 1 chapter. That\u2019s annoying and a waste of money. Like a $20 book you can keep forever or an online webtoon that you pay money to read each chapter and it has like 40+ chapters. Easy choice for me.","513":"Don't get me wrong I love all the stories and everything! But it is annoying when I can't sit there and read the next one because I have to pay... I've been on this app before all the you have to pay for this and that. I understand you need money somehow but I think it's a bit stupid. With what's going on right now too it's hard for people, and no I'm not saying all people BUT some people are having it harder. And I know people who read this will just be like then wait and don't spend the money. I just feel you maybe get more from slightly relaxing.","514":"Hey WEBTOON, the new ad feature you\u2019ve added to some of the stories like \u201cThat Awkward Moment\u201d by SomeBunny are having a lot of trouble playing and if they don\u2019t play then I can\u2019t read the story afterwards. I would like to know why you added ads to stories and then didn\u2019t make it so they\u2019d play correctly when I have to watch them. I can\u2019t read some of these stories now because I can\u2019t watch the ads you\u2019re making me watch. \nPlease fix this bug. It\u2019s honestly ridiculous that I have to ask you to fix an ad, something that I don\u2019t think should have been added in the first place, just so I can read a story I really like.","515":"Webtoons has many great comics and artists and has improved much in navigation. However I have some suggestions. 1. It\u2019s so hard to find your comment if you didn\u2019t get many likes or commented early. I think it should it should automatically be at the top of the page when you open the comment section. 2. Not necessary, but fun: a sort of tab on chapters you want to remember. Similar to the bookmark feature but instead of the chapter you left off on, it can be placed on many of your favorite chapters. Like a chapter with an important plot point or one you\u2019d like to reread sometime will be marked by an icon. That\u2019s it for now! Keep up the good work!","516":"Honestly I love this app sm, it\u2019s so amazing and the comics are just beautiful. The authors are such amazing bubbly people and are soo precious. The art is amazing as well as the story and plots. The new policy is a bit much but how do you not love webtoon. That\u2019s where I got my love for reading. Just from reading web comics. The stories give your heart life and it just makes me soooo happy whenever I read them. The community in webtoon and the fandoms.. are so pure and they are such lovely people! They are so funny. I recommend this app and manga!! (Fav stories are: Gourmet Hound, I love Yoo (and no that\u2019s not a typo), Sirens Lament, Age matters, Eggnoid.. and SOOO many others *tear* \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27\ud83d\udc96\u2728","517":"The comics are amazing! The styles are amazing, the story, and the people are amazing. I had internet (decent internet) and I went to webtoon to find it said \u2018offline\u2019 and it did that for a couple of days. So I deleted it, reinstalled it, and I\u2019m not able to log back in???? Why?? I\u2019m also not able to create a new account!! Can somebody please help? \n\nPs: when I delete the app and reinstall it, it tends to keep the subscribed webtoons, but, doesn\u2019t keep track of the ones I\u2019ve read... just wanted to let you know in case of fixing it, because I\u2019ve spent a few hours trying to find out where I left off...","518":"I love WEBTOON so much. \nThey have inspired me, helped me when I feel down, and I KNOW they deserve these 5 stars. They have the greatest comics, funniest comics, scariest comics, all the comics!! But, the best part is the art, and the authors. The time they spend to make these comics makes me realize how lucky I am.\nI have read some of these reviews, and seen that a lot of people hate the fast pass wait a week thing. Of course I hate it, but I think that it\u2019s worth it, and if you find many series(1 a day) every week, everyday, you get a new episode out!! I really don\u2019t think this is a big problem!!\ud83d\ude1c\nThank you so much WEBTOON!\u2764\ufe0f","519":"Ok so yeah I first off want to say this is an amazing app but seriously what is with the Daily thing. You made it sound like it was a good thing but it literally makes you wait forever to read a story. I usually never spend money on apps but this one I have bought my fair share of coins. I feel like it\u2019s just another way to make me spend money. The reason I usually get frustrated with other apps is I always feel they are pushing for more more more money. I understand you guys need to make money I would even understand if you had some advertisements and sold passes to skip those. However I\u2019m a little frustrated by the daily pass. I hope you consider removing or changing it.","520":"This app is really nice, and I\u2019ve enjoyed the past 3 years using it. The content is nice, there\u2019s a wide variety of comics to keep me occupied. But what made this app so unique and fun was the fact that it didn\u2019t have ads and the new fe authors \u201cdaily pass.\u201d When I go back to reread one of my favorite books now all a sudden I have to pay? All of these updates are causing more harm than good. I get the pay to read ahead, I\u2019m totally okay with that. Authors out hard work into their books. But if we\u2019ve already read something we should have the liberty to read it again without having to pay for it.","521":"Webtoon is a really great app with some helpful features but I\u2019ve always had one problem you can not multi task with Webtoon. It\u2019s either 100% or none at all so it gets annoying when I want to read it but also play a game at the same time but I have to dedicate more time to the app when a simple fix is a auto scroller. This just a recommendation but you can have a slider to adjust the speed 0 being none 1 being slow 5 being medium 10 being fast so it is adjustable to reading speed. That way you can enjoy your favorite Webtoons in bed hands free. Just and idea other wise the app is great beside a few minor bugs.","522":"So I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for 3-4 years now and it\u2019s been wonderful. I love the story\u2019s and the art and the way it is all set up adds a nice flow to it. Recently I\u2019ve been having a problem logging in and when I\u2019m able too it won\u2019t let me go to my subscribed section. Sometimes it won\u2019t even load as if I\u2019m logged in. When I\u2019m finally able to get into a story it just glitches and shuts down the app. I\u2019ve tried shutting down my Device and I\u2019ve also reinstalled the app multiple times. It just doesn\u2019t seem to work, if you could help me fix this or have an idea on how to, let me know.","523":"Um, I\u2019d Usually Give It A Five Star, But My Front Screen Keeps Saying No Connection, Everywhere I Go, Internet\/No Internet, It Goes To No Connection. So I Tried Deleting The App And Redownloading It, When I Logged It, It Still Had My Subscribed Series, But It Didn\u2019t Save The Progress Of Each Comic. It Isn\u2019t Fair, Now All Of My Progress I\u2019ve Worked On For Months\u2014Almost A Year Is Gone, I Waste Time Everyday Reading A Comic Because I Don\u2019t Have Much Apps Such As Games, But It\u2019s Unfair. It Still Has Them Subscribed, But It Doesn\u2019t Save? Why Is That? It\u2019s Just A Suggestion, If I Don\u2019t Find Updates On It, I Will Be Disappointed. I Won\u2019t Do Anything Though, I Was Just Confused And Frustrated Over This.","524":"I love the stories on the app. I don\u2019t mind how the app is set up. The thing I don\u2019t like is when you purchase coins and use them cause you can\u2019t wait for the next episode you get punished. Like I bought coins and read all the episodes that had been locked then thinking it would be like any other app I have had where the next locked episode would be unlocked the same amount of time as the one that I had already unlocked. Nope not how it works apparently no one said that would happen. I had to wait over almost two months to read the next episode because I refused to buy more then be punished for buying something. If you want to read just wait for the updates to be unlocked don\u2019t buy the coins definitely not worth it.","525":"I like the fast past it\u2019s a cool way to support comics we like and are currently reading. \n\nThe daily pass, while I see the concept and I\u2019m all for supporting creators, makes it less appealing to read. I was going back so I could read noblesse. I like going back to re read it helps refresh the memory but with this daily pass it\u2019s not possible without spending money every time you desire to re read it. If I understand the way it works.  With The lengths of the WEBTOONs that would be way to much money. \n\nI\u2019m one of those people who sits and finished a book in an afternoon. I would prefer to have my own copies of the books on my shelves, (I would buy hard copies, so I could re read them whenever.) As that\u2019s not an option. For me, having them be permanently unlocked when we pay for them would be more of a inventive to pay for chapters I\u2019ve already read. There are better ways to allow us to support the artists. \n\n \nLove the comics and I have enjoyed using this app for several years now.","526":"hey, so I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for a while now, and recently (a few weeks) it hasn\u2019t been loading correctly. anywhere and everywhere I go, even if I have a strong internet connection, it says that it cannot connect to Internet. it won\u2019t even load my subscribed webtoons anymore. I find this really annoying, as most others probably do as well. I\u2019m asking you fix this bug please, because it\u2019s getting to the point that I don\u2019t even want to open webtoon anymore on the account of this always happening. nothing ever loads anymore, and the system has even started to delete my subscribed webtoons instead of showing them. luckily I know which ones I like and read daily, but the recent updates don\u2019t load either. please fix this, I don\u2019t know how else to get this through without a bad rating. sorry. :\/","527":"I have been reading the amazing comics that the artists have made and they are wonderful! I love how the app is set up and how it\u2019s very easy to use. Unfortunately the new update for the NSFW has caused some of my favorite artists to either have to completely change their story or get of Webtoon entirely. As a reader I find no issue with the fact that the NSFW is censored and that they give a warning for 19+ but I find it very unfortunate and upset that some of the creators of these very interesting and good comics have to give up or change their whole story completely. Many people have also switched over to other sites just to read the comics that they once enjoyed on Webtoon. I would suggest to please change this new policy back to what is was so that way, these creators\/artists can go back to posting their work on Webtoon.","528":"Webtoon is great! I absolutely love it and I would TOTALLY Recommend it!.. If it wasn\u2019t for the daily pass. When webtoon added the daily pass to already completed webtoons it makes things much harder.. The webtoons already done finished and fresh waiting for you to read it and you\u2019ll end up waiting over 100 days (If the webtoons that long) to finish a webtoon because you don\u2019t have any or enough coins. And what\u2019s even worse is that once you\u2019ve spent your coins or waited that one day for one episode it\u2019ll only be available for 14 days which means if you end up finishing the webtoon and you wanna reread it you\u2019ll have to go through that whole process all over again","529":"This app is awesome I love the stories they are great but the only problem is that when you just start the app and the series you start is still making more seasons and your 100 episodes behind then that makes you really annoyed to wait every week not know when this person will stop the series and then I came with an idea every 12 to months you all should make it so we have a choice on what series we want every episode of that is out at the time and this app would be the best one in the world","530":"So, just today I clicked on the fast past episode, and it said there was a new device detected, and asked if I wanted to transfer to that device? I\u2019ve only logged into my account on this device, so I said no and tried again. I got the same error message so I figured it just wasn\u2019t recognizing my phone for some reason. So I thought, alright, I\u2019ll just register my phone again, no biggie. But! The only device it listed was my iPhone 6s, and the only option was to unregister it. I have no clue if I can re-register it after unregistering it, so I left it alone. But the problem still exists! (Help meh please)","531":"I really love webtoon and the stories in it, but the thing is, whenever I try to search for a webtoon like today, it doesn\u2019t show up sometimes. For example, when I was trying to search the dummy\u2019s dummy, I couldn\u2019t find it in the search results. Can you try making it easier to search for webtoons? I don\u2019t know what the problem is, but I think it\u2019s because of the capital letters possibly? I know that when searching, the original webtoons are usually what shows up, but can you make it easier to find canvas webtoons as well? Thank you","532":"I love Lore Olympus, it\u2019s really the only toon I watch on this app. I originally read it on Facebook but was then recruited when it told me that if I download the app I would get a free fast pass. Upon downloading, I never received the fast pass. I waited a while thinking it maybe takes time to process onto your profile and after a long enough period I just let it go. Now today I came across an ad on the app to watch 75 episodes of a show and receive 15 coins. After reading this(which I wasn\u2019t really entertained by) I NEVER RECEIVED THE COINS. That feels like a huge waste of time in my opinion. I\u2019ve tried reaching out to customer service and nothing. I really can\u2019t believe y\u2019all are making people waste their time doing things just to get coins and fast passes and you won\u2019t keep up on your end. VERY DISAPPOINTED","533":"I really like how I can read webcomics for free on this app, but I strongly disagree with the new policy. I feel like it is taking away a lot of creative freedom from the artists on discover AND the featured section. I don\u2019t quite understand it, because I just thought censoring a little bit of sexual content was fine, and I wasn\u2019t bothered by it. But now that some of my favorite discover artists have to change their plots to fit webtoon\u2019s guidelines just bothers me. It was a much better app before the new policy, and it used to be one of my favorites, but now I can\u2019t just feel the same way about it. Workers at Line Webtoon if you are reading this, please reconsider and reevaluate your new policy. Their are barely any young people on this app and I feel like putting the warnings was enough.","534":"I love this app to death and it broke my heart when i tried to use it to day and it said i had to register an phone i was already using so i thought maybe it was glitching so i deleted and re installed but to my horror it didnt sign me in properly meaning i no longer have my coins and i lost all of my progress on all of the webtoons i read and i actually cried because i still had more than 40 coins that i could have used to get early access and now I have to start all over again it hurts me that this happened I might have to delete this app forever if this were to happen again ;-; also how was my device not registered now I no longer have coins or my progress","535":"This is my favorite app for reading webtoons; there are so many great stories to read, and all the currently updating stories are free. Highly suggest giving it a try, there is a great variety so I would find it hard to believe that there isn\u2019t something for everyone. \n\nPreviously I had written a review commenting on how after the last update I had been unable to take part in promotional events due to the app freezing whenever the pop ups occurred. I followed the suggested advice of clearing cache and the redownloading the app, and it worked. Unfortunately, it completely wiped my browsing history. Not surprising, but a little disheartening.","536":"I love the app and the stories on it, I\u2019ve used webtoon for a while now on my iPad but I got a new phone and wanted to use webtoon on my phone instead. So I signed in but when I go to my subscribed comics it shows that I\u2019ve read none of the episodes in them and it makes me a little frustrated because some comics have over 200+ episodes and I don\u2019t want to go through each and everyone. If there was some sort of feature that would help this I would be super grateful. I love the app though and I\u2019m making a story with my friend but please add that feature!","537":"I love WEBTOON and a lot of the stories but the coins and free pass thing is to much. Using coins to read new episodes early I might understand but only being allowed to read one episode a day on a completed series is not a good feature. This doesn\u2019t help anything, it doesn\u2019t make them money, it just irritates readers. It honestly makes me less likely to finish stories and I no longer want to read stories because of this. Others I know feel the same way which is why they don\u2019t use the app anymore. This feature is doing more bad than good. Just a suggestion, remove this feature and let us read completed series\u2019s without the need for daily passes. Thanks !","538":"I love this app so much I had it for a few years now the only thing I have to complain about is the bugs with the canvas comics. The update makes you watch ads I have no problem watching ads the problem is when I go to watch the ads is automatically pops up and says ad could not load I have a strong internet connection so I don\u2019t think that could be why it\u2019s not working I think it\u2019s a bug in the system from the recent update. I\u2019ve tried to watch an ad I believe a couple days ago and it still didn\u2019t work. Then I got on it to day and it automatically said couldn\u2019t load ad. So now that this keeps happening I can\u2019t read canvas comics and it makes me upset :\/","539":"Honestly, I don\u2019t often write reviews but this app has me intensely frustrated.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE the content on there. This is hands down an essential app for people who love webcomics and I have SO many favorites on this app.\n\nBut there are so many problems with the actual app itself! I\u2019ve been pretty okay with the new fast pass implementation, and I think that it\u2019s a great way to support artists. However, ever since the Webtoon app has expanded, there have been problems with connectivity that I KNOW are singular to this app.\n\nFor example, even though I\u2019m connected to the wifi, I almost constantly have issues trying to load chapters I want to read. It\u2019s SUCH a pain! I often have to go out and back into chapters, and sometimes my wifi connection switches to using LTE for this app, and I just don\u2019t know why. This wasn\u2019t previously a problem, so I know it\u2019s not just because of the amount of photos! \n\nOtherwise, this is a solid app\u2014 it could use some improvements, but the content is worth it for the terrible user experience.","540":"I\u2019ve been having this problem since last night. I\u2019m glad to see that other people have already written about this bug and I\u2019m not the only one getting these problems, since my sister isn\u2019t having any problems with the app. But I\u2019m having trouble with loading my comics, which can\u2019t even open, and how the screen freezes when I press the originals\/canvas page or when I try to open a comic. I\u2019ve logged out and back in, re-downloaded the app, and powered off my phone as attempts to fix it, but nothing worked! Please let this get to your attention!","541":"I have had this app for a while, and have noticed that at the end of a chapter, there\u2019s usually an ad or something like that. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but when I scroll down, my thumb or forefinger might hit the ad, and WEBTOON will relocate me to at least 3 different sites in Safari until I get rid of the \u201ctab.\u201d \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, then I\u2019ll get a buffering symbol on my screen that relocates me to ads at random until I get rid of the tab and open it again.\n\nAgain, maybe this is just me, but please fix this so that I don\u2019t have to accidentally visit sites about diamond rings or Safeway.","542":"I used to really like this app! I would use it daily & made sure that I had at least one series for each day of the week! I love multiple series both on the canvas and originals pages. However, ever since the last update (updated Dec 26 or so), my app doesn\u2019t even open. I see the green \u201cWEBTOONS\u201d page for a half-second and it crashes. It\u2019s super upsetting, as I am deeply invested in some of these stories, and I can\u2019t access them on the mobile format.\n\nI\u2019m also sad, because I participated in their Tower of God challenge (great series, btw), but didn\u2019t click the final \u201cclaim reward\u201d and never got the chance to click it after x-ing out of the page (if someone reads 100 chapters, just give them the 5 coins lol). This being said, it was really a minor frustration compared to the fact that I cannot even open the app.","543":"I absolutely love the app. Webtoons has helped me through some times with their wonderfully written featured stories, and the daily-growing discover.\nI would give it a 5 star rating: if it weren\u2019t for the new mature content ban.\nA lot of discover writers and artists are turning to Tapas, or others of the such due to this, as they can no longer be paid for their content. \nWe have mature content warnings, so isn\u2019t that enough? Why ban censored 19+ when the people who read it know what is to come, and already went through to read it.\nI don\u2019t see as to why a ban was put, due to people disliking and complaining about such things that were warned.","544":"I love this app. I really do. Over the past few months since I\u2019ve heard of it and downloaded it, I\u2019ve been pretty addicted, and I\u2019ve subscribed to my fare share of good comics. Here\u2019s the thing, however... more often than not, the images themselves won\u2019t load. On an app that runs completely on pictures, drawings, and comics, there is a bug getting in my way that won\u2019t let me see those. Please, all I want to do is read Tower of God! My WiFi is fine, my phone is updated, even the app is updated, so why, why won\u2019t my Webtoons load?? I\u2019d really love it if the company could fix this once and for all. I would be your loyal customer if I could just read your content. Please fix this bug.","545":"I love this app and the content it brings, just one small thing. Recently I\u2019ve found that when I click certain WEBTOONs it will close me out of the app. I\u2019ve tried reopening the app, turning my phone off, shutting my phone down, but no matter what those certain WEBTOONs won\u2019t work at all. And more keep adding themselves to the list of those that shut down the app. They work just fine when you open them in an internet tab, but not at all on the app. Hoping this can be fixed soon as I haven\u2019t been able to easily read some of my favs for a while!!","546":"I absolutely love this app. I mainly have it for Lore Olympus. I use purchase the fast passes as soon as the next chapter is available and I just love the stories. They are very professional. However, this time I got a notification that the next chapter\/episode was available and my account was completely deleted!! My subscriptions, fast past were all gone! I have to repurchase chapters I had already purchased and booked marked and all my subscriptions where gone! My email wasn\u2019t even able to be found. I hope it dosent happen again. I love this app but that was a critical set back for me.","547":"It had always warned people of mature content and if this is about children\u2019s parents getting upset over the mature content that\u2019s their fault for not monitoring their children\u2019s activity. This not only makes things less enjoyable for people looking for mature content, but this also hurts WEBTOON\u2019s creators because sometimes the mature content is important to the comic\u2019s storyline. Also before the new policy there was never anything graphic or full on mature content that wasn\u2019t censored and even if it wasn\u2019t censored the creators would always go back and fix allowing them to tell their comic without having to remove the comic and vital parts to the story completely, but now creators are being punished for following the old guidelines and now having to remove what they\u2019ve created","548":"I\u2019ve been searching for comic based apps it seemed like forever and all the ones that I\u2019ve downloaded before this have been absolute crap. You can\u2019t get through one chapter without at least 2 ads popping up but WEBTOON is honestly the best and I\u2019m never going back. With WEBTOON, you see an ad every once in a while and the best part...the ads are just banners I dont think I\u2019ve ever seen a video ad since I got this app and I\u2019ve had it for a little over a year now. All I can say is this app is the one to get. It\u2019s perfect such a variety of genres. A must have app 10\/10!","549":"I LOVE this app! Comics are free to read, easy to subscribe to, and ads are kept to a minimum, in undistracting places. No pop-ups. The staff even holds competitions every now and then! Read a comic, not sure if you wanna subscribe, but still want to find out what happens next before you commit? No problem. Comics you\u2019ve viewed are easy to find! Subscribing just makes it even easier. You can also comment and interact with other readers! and new comics are advertised weekly to potential readers, making finding new ones to read easy! I can\u2019t recommend this app enough.","550":"I love webtoon a lot and wouldeve gave it a 5 star but there's one thing I would like to be fixed. So I go on webtoon to find that I need to log in. No big deal. But I put in my Google account instead of my gmail so I was confused about where all my subscribed went. I realized my mistake and decided to log out. But, I could not figure out how to log out. So I uninstalled and reinstalled. I logged in with my gmail account and I got all my subscribed back. BUT all my recently read was gone so that means all my bookmarks were gone. I would like it if it saved your bookmarks and didn't think of you as a new reader even though your acc is old.","551":"What you did was not \u201cminor bug fixes\u201d you turned down the amount of episodes per day that we can watch on completed series from three episodes, TO ONE! One freaking episode?!?!? Really? I\u2019m way to obsessed with this app to only be able to watch one episode a day of the completed series I want to watch! You money-hungry buffoons!!!!! This is a very bed update, and I ask that it be removed, as I am sure other users of this app will agree with me when I say that one episode is not nearly enough! But other than that I love the app.\n\nPS. Sry about the rant I really love this app and was just angry I couldn\u2019t read farther into the series without buying coins.","552":"The app works well and the content is great but Daily Pass is obscenely expensive and horrible. Even if I\u2019ve fast passed through episodes in the past, if it\u2019s a completed series then I have to pay to read it AGAIN or wait several days or weeks? And then there\u2019s too much pressure to check it every day or read it on time. I\u2019m an adult and I have a busy life, sometimes I don\u2019t read comics for a couple months. Everyone who loves Webtoon loves to binge read them! This is a really terrible feature and no one will want to pay $100+ for a comic series they already read once for free, ESPECIALLY since they don\u2019t get to keep the episodes they buy! They disappear after 14 days as well! I would be happier to pay a monthly fee to read as much as I like in the times that work best for me.","553":"Ok I\u2019ve been using Webtoon for a few years now and read on it every night. I first saw it around 2016 when I saw an ad for Bastard. (Which was amazing) I have no idea if this is related but Webtoon has become more slow then any app I\u2019ve been on I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s just me. But also checked and saw ALL THE REVIEWS about daily passes, and how it\u2019s on Bastard and a lot of other comics. Which is disgraceful to the Webtoon community, I\u2019m lucky enough that I was able to come early and read it. But I\u2019m disgusted for the new people on the app, Bastard was one of the reasons I kept the app and downloaded it in the first place. I love this app but you have no reason to do this whatsoever. Get. Rid. Of. Daily. Passes.","554":"I have no complaints. The ads are things that are completely out of the way, at the end of episodes occasionally. 100% free and all of it is awesome. I highly recommend you download and start reading. The app will send you notifications when a new episode has been released for any of the authors or strips you have subscribed to (100% no cost!) they also made it easy for you to find the top hits of your favorite genre. You can also, if you wish, search for strips that release new episodes on the days that you want.","555":"I really love the app but there's been a bothering issue as links that could either lead to porn sites or viruses have been continuously been showing up in the comment section of almost every comic I read. A lot of the times, those links are found as a reply to every users' comments. They don't do anything unless you try to use those links, but it's frankly getting annoying and I'm concerned for the younger readers. I'm not going to delete my account and the WEBTOONS app because of this, but I'm sure many users including me would appreciate it if the issue is dealt with. Thank you!","556":"You guys need in all access pass to the comics with a monthly subscription like other apps I pay for. This one is ridiculously priced. .99 cents for a episode\/chapter? What are we made of money?? I\u2019d pay monthly like 6$ a month. You have some good books but not there are better apps. Sorry if I\u2019m harsh but I like helping in way that can possibly help. Anyways it\u2019s a great layout and simple but biggest con is 99cent a chapter after a certain time reading MOST books on here. Or you can wait 5 days for another 12 page chapter and then have to wait another 5 friking days. Or keep paying them dollars that are practically destroying your wallets for a 12 page chapter. Sorry rant review over. I just like this app and now hate it ..","557":"Adding the daily pass system to completed webtoons is a very bad move. It needs to be changed.\n\nI used to recommend this app to friends all the time but now I don\u2019t think I can.\n\nAt the very least I would feel better about it if they added a subscription service so that we can pay a small monthly fee and then get unlimited daily passes to completed comics. Being forced to pay per pass could get incredibly expensive very quickly.\n\nI used to stay awake all night binging some of my favorite webtoons only to cry when they were over because the story was so good. Now if I wanted to do that I would have to pay a huge amount of money. Binging is honestly one of the best ways to read and the fact that WEBTOON is robbing this from us and putting it behind a giant paywall is upsetting.\n\nAt least offer a discounted rate to unlock every pass for a specific webtoon! \n\nI am seriously not against paying a little bit of money, I already have done so and wouldn\u2019t mind doing it again. However their recent decision is the best way to kill all the best parts about the app and to drive away loyal fans. We want to be able to reread the comics we already know and love.","558":"When I say this i mean it. I love Webtoon. Its ana amzing app and very addicting. great stories from many creators and something for everyone. When the app had the new \"whatch an ad to read this episode early\" thing, I thought it was a great add-on and could not wait to try it. The first 3 times is great it loads the ad and its a short one. But then one day they stop loading, at least easily. I have to try to load it multiple times during the day and sometimes i just decide to wait for when it comes out without an ad to avoid the struggle. Please fix this problem, but otherwise i would defiantly recommend the app.","559":"Honestly, I was having a good time on Webtoon until I got a new phone and had to restart the app. I didn\u2019t have any of my data saved so I had to sign back in onto my account. I\u2019ve been trying for so long and I thought it was my fault but I checked my email and it had records of my data on WEBTOON yet the app won\u2019t let me login, saying that the email address was incorrect and there are no accounts associated with the email address. All the progress I have on Webtoon are erased and now I don\u2019t know what chapter I\u2019m up to and I really don\u2019t know what I can do. Also, I tried resetting my password multiple times even though it was the right one and it still won\u2019t let me in. Additionally, I just resettled the password and saved it and it said the password was wrong?!? I\u2019m really confused and upset. Help me out, WEBTOON.","560":"I love reading and get lost every time, I\u2019ll find a new comic, read for a little bit, and don\u2019t realize 5 hours have gone by as I got caught up. It\u2019s still four stars, but the wait is too long. Take for example Sirens Lament, it\u2019s been going for 2 or 3 years, but still has so much more to go. It takes most everyone a minute to read through each clip, and at one clip of the story a week... it\u2019s just too slow. Amazing creative stories, but if WEBTOON can, they need to pay creators more so they can take more time off for their stories. I know the public doesn\u2019t like it, but it might be better to throw in a few more ads.","561":"This is my absolute favorite app! Its the funnest thing ever! The fact that you can download them is awesome. Im addicted and love this app and have been for a year or two. But i want to let the people downloading this know: DO NOT i repeat DO NOT follow links in webtoon comments. Theres a lot of people, and i mean like i get notifications 3-5 times a week of people commenting these links, and they all lead to bad things. Theres 2 or 3 sites ive noticed they are most common for and they arent good. One friends phone got hacked from the site so please be careful. \n\nBasically this in a summary is: GREAT APP, BE CAREFUL!","562":"Almost all of the webtoons and manhwa I\u2019ve read from this app are amazing, there are no issues with the app itself and bookmarking is an amazing feature. The only thing that bothers me in the slightest are the dry comments that think they\u2019re all of a sudden famous for getting a top comment, or they also point out an obvious connection in the story in order to get likes. Although it\u2019s petty of me to think so, I hope that there will one day be actual thought provoking comments rather than the same circle-jerked brainless garbage that we call top comments","563":"This app is amazing in every single way in my opinion. I really don\u2019t care what everyone says about me or this app! I look forward to read for once \ud83d\ude0a.\n   When I was little I hated reading \ud83d\udcd6 I hated it with all my heart, I knew how to read I just hated it \u0285\uff08\u25de\u203f\u25df\uff09\u0283 . But now that I have this... wow \ud83e\udd29 it changed my life! \n   On my free time I do my normal hobby\u2019s, which now includes reading WEBTOON\u2019s and other books. Not only do I like to read WEBTOON\u2018s but WEBTOON has brought my to learn and love other genres I didn\u2019t even know were a real thing.  \n   I recommend this app to anyone in the world \ud83d\uddfa. If you like to read or not.","564":"I\u2019ve been reading WEBTOON for about a year and recently I\u2019ve noticed stuff popping up about fast passes. I thought this was pretty greedy on their part but it didn\u2019t restrict me from waiting every week. But I recently wanted re read one of my favorite comics \u201cgirls of the wild\u201d and I have to PAY COINS or use a limited time daily pass to read over the thr 8th episode!! This is greedy! The comic is over! Fast passes are fine I get it but really? Making me pay for a comic that\u2019s done? And the passes only last 14 days! WEBTOON please take that off! Your turning into every other comic service! I like you cause your free! I can read whatever I want for free! Keep the fast passes but take off the restrictions on old comics that are completed! Please! I\u2019m begging you!","565":"I have been using WEBTOON for over a year now and their new policy is infuriating. Not only does this restrict authors from creating NSFW content which many of the times is not even NSFW, but the new coin policy makes me want to delete the app. The only way to get coins is to pay for it and the only money I ever spend on webtoon is to help the authors who\u2019s works I enjoy. I don\u2019t know where this money is going, but these coins are used to view new updates on many of the webtoons on which I have been reading. I hope they realize how unhappy I am about this, and does not make me want to use this app anymore when I could just find my favorite webtoons on other websites which they promote themselves on. Sorry not sorry. Sincerely your very disappointed user","566":"This app was one of the greatest apps I ever came across to read people\u2019s own work. They were free to do what they wanted as long as it was censored (which was fine), But then, the new policy showed up which banned all NSFW content. A few creators decided to leave out of frustration and this broke my heart. Their freedom to do as they please with the webtoons they created from scratch, the ones they put their heart and soul into, have been restricted. Previous chapters have been deleted and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. If the security went up to make sure that the reader was in fact over the age to read said chapter, I\u2019d be more than okay with it. As long as it\u2019s not something like this that restricts the creators from doing what they had planned. I don\u2019t know what happened, but this change is not a good one. \n #letafujoshiread","567":"I used to love webtoon, but I took a big break but recently I have been trying to get back into webtoon, but sadly webtoon has removed or the bookmark function has stopped working properly. I miss when I can just go back to a specific story and exactly where I was would appear. But no it just takes me back to the last chapter, so I literally have to go to the next chapter and scroll, and whenever I leave the app for like five minutes I have to do the process all over again. It\u2019s getting really annoying and ruining my experience. I hope something can be done soon.","568":"This app is possibly the best comic app ever known to man. It's like the comic version of Wattpad, but it doesn't have thousands of cheesy plot lines with the same repetitive plot twist over and over again. Comics take time and dedication and determination to complete, which is why the majority of the comics on Webtoon is (on a scale of 1 to 10) an 8 or higher. You're able to look at amazing art for so long, and they have good plot! It's a win-win situation too since the comic creators get their name out there and have a place to use their creativity. I have literally no problems with this app. It's amazing. Hands down. Download it.","569":"I gotta day, I really do like the app. It\u2019s nice being able to be entertained, especially at a time like this. However, the new thing where you need an add to unlock some episodes is kind of glitchy. Most of the time it tells me that it\u2019s unable to load an add (even when I\u2019m connected to internet) or it tells me something is wrong in my settings and when I follow the steps it tells me to do it still doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not a huge deal bc most of the comics I read don\u2019t have the add thing but it is an inconvenience for the ones that do. Overall though the app is great and entertaining!","570":"I started using this app for about two-ish years. I LOVED it and i was always on it. However, they have been making some changes. Fast pass? I don\u2019t really mind but I usually go onto the completed section so I can binge-read. It\u2019s really annoying when the best webtoons have a daily pass. For example, Orange Marmalade. I\u2019ve read it already but i\u2019d like to read it again but it would take me around two months to do so. It\u2019s also quite annoying how it expires in 14 days. I don\u2019t want to wait two months reading it every time I want to reread the comic. Other than that, i have no complaints and i still REALLY love this app!!","571":"There is new content being published every single day - whether it\u2019s authors posting new comics or just updating chapters and that\u2019s what I love about this app! The reason why it\u2019s 4 out of 5 stars for me (because honestly I have no other complaints about Webtoons) is the fact that you can only subscribe to 100 \u201cDiscover\u201d comics. I\u2019ve had the app for about 4 months now and I\u2019ve already subscribed to 100 stories (I read a TON in case you couldn\u2019t tell) and there\u2019s so many more that I can\u2019t follow \/ support the creator because there\u2019s a limit. Webtoons make a limitless reading list update so I can subscribe to more content and support more creators!!!","572":"The two stars here are only for the amazing authors and stories. WEBTOON itself, however... has become a mess. The app crashes constantly, and for the past 3 days i haven\u2019t been able to even read comics. I\u2019m used to minor crashes, but this is just ridiculous. \nPlus, \u201cThe Devil Is A Handsome Man\u201d... this amazing and beautiful webcomic has never returned from hiatus, and it\u2019s absolutely not the fault of the author. She\u2019s produced new chapters, but WEBTOON won\u2019t get them published. And because of the contract with them, she can\u2019t post them anywhere else. Garbage, honestly.\nAnd the new \u201cDaily Pass\u201d is probably the worst thing that could have happened to this app. I\u2019m honestly debating just deleting it all together. \nGet yourself together, WEBTOON.","573":"I hate bringing down the rating but I HATE the fact they made a new policy.  It\u2019s 18+ for a reason guys. The people who download this app are either adults or underage people who\u2019s parents are ok with them reading this type of stuff. The new policy takes the joy out of reading Bl\u2019s, and, to be honest, all the new policy is doing is promoting usage to other websites\/apps. Often I, and other people I know, have gone to Tapas and other websites that have the same exact stories with less extreme restrictions. All you creators are doing is bringing down your rating and usage, and if the thought in making this app was to let people enjoy it then I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing anymore. Not for me, at least. Other people are also frustrated, I\u2019m sure. The new policy, for me and BL fandoms, is a bother. Please change it.","574":"Webtoon is amazing, I think we can all agree on that. I open it up when I\u2019m free or I\u2019m just bored. Although, recently Webtoon has released the new policy regarding no sexual content. Which is unfair to many, many, discover authors who built their story around this type of content. Even after many warnings that the authors have given about the content on their story, younger audiences tend to stick around to hate and report it. Now after the policy, tons of creators are forced to move to a different website to write\/illustrate amazing artwork. This is why I think the age restrictions should be 13+. I seriously love this app and don\u2019t want it to go down the drain because of something as little as this.","575":"My commute home used to be spent aimlessly browsing the web and reading news in a desperate attempt to pretend I'm not in a mobile homeless shelter that will slowly deteriorate my will to live. NO LONGER. Now I read an endless rabbit hole of high quality webcomics, all of which are absolutely free. Also, I've discovered \"Space Boy\" through this app, which is currently occupying my every thought during the day when I'm not reading it. It's Sci-Fi Drama at its absolute finest with incredibly well written dialogue and characters that'll hook you hard. \nDownload this app and don't look back.","576":"Oof where to even start? This app makes it sooo easy to read comics (and this is always truly appreciated). Because, still being a high school student with no money... I'm always grateful that You guys give us the ability to read these wonderful comics for free. I've checked out other platforms to read comics only because there are so many other writers out there, but webtoon is definitely THE BEST. Easy to access, easy to use, and by far the most used app out what I have. \ud83d\udcaf\n\n (that update where you guys took out tap to scroll messed me up tho x_x)","577":"I absolutely love Webtoons. I first discovered this app 2 years ago and it has been a part of my daily life ever since. I love how it\u2019s a place for people to come and enjoy something together. However, I have a slight concern with the latest update. This update has removed the tap to scroll future that I absolutely adore. This was the most convenient feature for me on the go. Because of this new update, I am unable to quickly read Webtoons on the go as I used to. It would be nice if you re-added that feature as an option that can be changed in the settings. Thank you for all your hard work! :)","578":"It\u2019s a great app, works perfectly fine, I\u2019ve never had any issues at all. But the coin system is a bad idea for customers. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading something and and you want to read the next chapter but it\u2019s locked and you want to buy the next chapter, the time till the chapter after the one you bought releases stays the same. Like I\u2019m completely caught up on one webtoon, and if i don\u2019t buy the next chapter that just came out, I have to wait 43 days till I can read it for free. I\u2019d say it would be a better business idea to reset the time till the next chapter releases for a webtoon you used coins on.","579":"I really REALLY like this App HOWEVER their is this one tiny thing I want to add I just wanted to know if theirs any way you could add a organizers to it so you can organize your webtoons kinda like a playlist because I have a lot of comics im subscribed to but I'm not reading ALL of them their just their just in case I wanted to really them later but then they get crowded with the ones I am reading then it gets annoying to find and ik a lot of people in who use this app do the same thing and think the same thing but the app is still great without it just thought it would be cool to add.","580":"I wish it was like before where we didn\u2019t have to pay to read, that is one of the reasons why I love this app I mean I still use it but having to pay now is a bit sad. Well not we don\u2019t have to pay if we don\u2019t want to of course! We can just wait, but when a series ends we have to get daily passes and then after that pay :( sometimes I wish it was like before where we didn\u2019t have to pay with coins. Either way that is my opinion... but I\u2019m still going to read because I love it no matter if I have to wait or just use a free pass with coins (though I will rarely use them)","581":"I love this app a lot, but since they added the daily pass to some completed webtoons it gets a bit frustrating. I'm currently reading Oh!Holy! and it's taking a lot longer to read then it should. I don't spend money on apps and I'm ok with waiting a week for new episodes on incomplete webtoons and I get the company is trying to make more money, but it gets annoying how you have to wait a day just to read another episode of a webtoon, especially if your rereading a webtoon. Usually it would take me a couple weeks to finish a completed webtoon but with the daily pass it's gonna take me 140 days to finish it.","582":"Ok to start off I love this app it's great, I spent the entire day reading one of the books! My only problem is that it's really slow, and glitchy. It's not a huge deal but I would really appreciate if they got that fixed. One thing I actually experienced today was these weird people sending everyone in the comment section on the tenth episode of \" Lost In Transition\" gross links to ummm not child friendly things I have already reported the comments but I don't know if they'll handle it. Please take care of the problem! Overall I think this app is fantastic and you should definitely get it! \ud83d\ude42\nFrom,\nanyoneArmy?","583":"I Love this app. and I think it\u2019s really good, it has a lot of great stories\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc but recently a new update came out seen it fixed a couple of minor bugs so I tried to open it and every time I open it it keeps shutting me out\ud83d\ude20 I reset in my phone and gone back in and it still takes me out i\u2019ve even deleted and re-downloaded the app and it\u2019s still not working if you guys could fix this this would be really nice\ud83e\udd7abecause I love the stories in here they\u2019re really creative\u2728 and if yours is working you should honestly try the app.","584":"Okay fast pass I get I\u2019m in agreement with fast passes because it\u2019s not locking the content behind a pay wall forever; it\u2019s just saying wait if you want it free, pay if you want it early which is fine and all but what I don\u2019t understand is daily passes I can easily find these manhwas online for free additionally if you do use your coins for a daily pass you can only read that chapter for 2 weeks then it\u2019s locked again that\u2019s ridiculous you're splitting your user base with daily passes which just shows how little your corporation cares about us users which is sad cause this app is really amazing but it\u2019s slowly getting poisoned by the greedy executives","585":"I really love this app! My one qualm with it is that I can\u2019t publish unless I draw on a computer. I use a mobile app to draw, as I can\u2019t afford an iPad\/computer for art, and I find it sad I can\u2019t publish anything. The website automatically redirects me to the app so it\u2019s a no go.\n\nMy thinking was that they should make an app or an extension dedicated to publishing from mobile, so I, and others, can share our stories\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love just reading all the series here, but I have an idea I can\u2019t wait to put on canvas, and the fact that I don\u2019t have a computer that supports a drawing program\/uploading my art","586":"Ok I\u2019ve only have webtoon for about 1 1\/2 years but let me tell you this app is amazing,I love it so much however the fast pass is kinda of annoying but they need to pay the authors so it\u2019s not problem paying for episodes, you get one episode every week and it\u2019s a great thing to look forward too some series I would 100% Recommend are Unordinary,SubZero,Cursed Princess Club,Lore Olympus, Freaking Romance, True beauty and there are many others that are amazing but those really are absolutely great series that anyone can enjoy :)","587":"see, i love this app. its great. theres free webcomics from great artists, theres decent quality, interesting stories that i can spend until five in the morning binge reading. you can read ahead by paying money, you can support artists on patreon. its great. it really is. \n \nbut i have a slight problem. a very teeny tiny small problem. \n\ntoday opened the app, and saw a webtoon i wanted to read. i went to check out the description, and to my surprise, a big, huge ad pops up, blocking me from checking what its about. \n\nyou see, im usually okay with ads. they need money, and don\u2019t we all? Just trying to live out here you know. where there\u2019s a free app, there\u2019s ads. okay. thats fine. cool, just going along with it. but when the ad is blocking a fourth of the screen, it isn\u2019t okay. could you please make the ad smaller? like, small enough so i can read the description of the webtoon, or close out of it? this is like, my only complaint, and if you could fix this it would be great.","588":"This app is great and lets you read amazing content. However, it is not worth 5 stars because of the webtoon downloading policy. Downloading webtoons are important for when you want to go on trips and such and won\u2019t have wifi. The current policy for downloading webtoons is that you can only download it once for 30 days because of copyright restrictions. This restriction does nothing to stop people from downloading content (because you can create a new account) and instead just makes it a hassle. If this were to be fixed then I would rate this app 5 stars, and I am sure others would agree with me.","589":"(I\u2019ve been on webtoon for a long time but I\u2019ve been too broke to ever buy coins u.u)\n\nHi, a few days ago I completed the tower challenge to read 100 episodes for fun, I came back and on the 23rd it popped up saying claim, but when I clicked claim and refreshed I had 0, to test if I had any I spent it on one episode for a webtoon I do not recall and then it said amount left: 0, and then I clicked on the episode to read but it blacked out and when I came back to try to read again i clicked on the episode I thought I purchased but it said you have 0 coins go to the coin shop?","590":"I absolutely LOVE Webtoons since it\u2019s so SO hard to find good decent comic apps that are FREE, and I enjoyed bingeing completed series. I would read them for hours on end barely able to put my phone down, and earlier I wanted to read a completed series and Daily Pass showed up. I have absolutely no idea what good this is supposed to bring but I do know that it really aggravated me since it was SO much better beforehand. Now I\u2019ve got to wait for completed series to update as if they were ongoing, or they ask for all of my money (spoiler alert: I don\u2019t have any) this is super SUPER frustrating and although I love this app, I have to give it the stars that I did because of this. Please PLEASE fix this Webtoons I know I\u2019m not the only person who feels this way.","591":"I absolutely LOVED this app when I first got it and would have gladly rated it 5 stars! However, it\u2019s been gaining a lot of popularity recently. And that\u2019s usually a great thing, but most apps like this, like Wattpad for example, start out as simply free reading apps, but once they become widely known, they\u2019ll \u201clock\u201d later chapters from the public, and you can only read them by paying for coins to \u201cunlock\u201d the chapters. The first five or six chapters are like a preview, and you have to buy the entire book. WEBTOON is allowing chapters to become free after some time, but no one wants to wait a MONTH just to read ONE more part. These coins systems absolutely ruin reading apps for me, and I SINCERELY hope they take this off the app. So DEFINITELY only two stars now.","592":"Okay don\u2019t get me wrong this app is like a 10\/10 well before the new rules... Because when you have a \u201cmature\u201d comic there\u2019s usually a warning that say something like \u201c19 years or older\u201d and you can\u2019t say \u201coh I didn\u2019t get a warning\u201d even when you say okay or yes the author usually says on the top like \u201cmature content\u201d to give us our second warning and you can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t get a warning I didn\u2019t know this was going to happen because you did you had two warnings or more and there\u2019s usually not a lot of younger kids here not the ages between 7-10 and if there are they wouldn\u2019t be reading mature content maybe something like \u201cI love too\u201d or \u201cGamers\u201d that are really popular but I believe the viewers are more older and maturer so we don\u2019t need the new rules you should take them out","593":"I really love this app for reading web comics but I\u2019m not a person who has time to log onto my webtoon account daily. I often go weeks at a time between opening the app to get some reading in and if I\u2019m gone for a certain amount of time it erases all my progress in the web comics I\u2019ve been reading. It will not have any of the episodes marked as read so I have to search around for several minutes just trying to find where I left off which is very frustrating and sometimes makes me lose interest in the story or spoils things. If they\u2019d fix that issue it would be perfect.","594":"I was hesitant at first to get this app as I thought there would be nothing I liked and there would be tons of pay walls to keep up with the webtoons but, boy was I wrong, everything about this app is great from the diversity of the creators and comics, to the amazing community that reads them, there are so many different comics that it\u2019s impossible to say there is not one comic you like, there is such a great community and the producers, and creators interact with community as well, overall if you are thinking about getting it, don\u2019t you\u2019ll love it, no doubt about it.","595":"This app is amazing!! I always love to open it and see the comics I love update! The only problem for me and for some artists I\u2019ve seen is the NSFW policy, I see some artists go \u201cI\u2019m sorry no episode because of the nsfw policy\u201d because they\u2019re not allowed to post what they want their comic to be like, I\u2019m just hoping that at some point there could be like and 18+ section or something so they aren\u2019t forced to make people pay to see their comic on patreon or tapas. I realize that kids could be reading some but that\u2019s why there\u2019s the 18+ check before every inappropriate comic right? Just a personal preference but overall an awesome app!","596":"Whenever I feel sad or have had a really bad day I sheets love to go on Webtoon and read for hours on end!! I love all of the manga\u2019s they have to offer. This is a really great app and I love it. But some feedback I\u2019d like to give is that it would be better if we didn\u2019t have to wait weeks for a new episode to come out considering that some of them are really short. Also, I don\u2019t like the idea of daily pass on some of the manga\u2019s I like to re-read and in daily pass it only allows you to read to chapters a day. But other than that it\u2019s a great app!!","597":"This used to be a 100% free to use app. Then they introduced coins. You get to read up to 3 episode (1 episode free per week on majority features webtoons) but you have to keep paying or wait 4 weeks for a new episode. $1 is 10 coins. It\u2019s 5 coins per ep. so if you have over 10 webtoons you\u2019re reading you\u2019ll pay $5 a week. NOW they have the audacity to make some COMPLETED webtoons only available when buying each individual episode which can range from 70 to over a 100 episode. With only 5 being free. You get 1 free episode per day which only last 14 days. So you can either spend $35 to read 70 episodes or wait 65 days to finish it. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! Fast past to new episodes fine! BASICALLY FORCE ME TO SPEND MONEY TO READ THR WHOLE THING. NOT FINE","598":"I\u2019ve had this app for over two years and it has never let me down, but there is one issue that has been happening recently to me. I don\u2019t know if other people are having this issue but at the end of almost every comic there is a add with a play button and a buffering circle around it and every time I pass it even if I don\u2019t touch it to scroll a buffering circle will pop up onto my screen and then immediately take me to a website online. I don\u2019t know why or if this is just happening to me but if it isn\u2019t just a issue I\u2019m alone having please fix it.","599":"Okay so, I have recently switched phones which has signed me out of most apps (including webtoon) i remember everything from my email to password. I tried signing in, but it says my email has not been registered. Then I try creating a new account using the EXACT same email. It then says the email has already been registered. Like what!? I have been so frustrated with this app and just want to continue my story which was on MY account. I love these amazing stories, but this app has TONS of bugs. I tried  to start a new story to read and I click on take me to first episode. YET IT TAKES ME TO THE 63RD EPISODE. Please tell me you have fixed it because it is VERY VERY frustrating!","600":"Hey, WEBTOON! I would like to request that in the next update you add a BL and GL tab. I fond it personally hard to find good BL because there is no rating system and Category for it yet. I Really enjoy the app but I agree with a lot of people here that it was better when the \u201cpolice\u201d wasn\u2019t in place. I find a lot of my favorite authors scared that they may have to cancel the story or that they might have to move it to another platform, which I find awful BECAUSE  webtoon is such a great app. So please take my suggestions into consideration because I think it would make my and a lot of other people\u2019s experience woth WEBTOON even MORE enjoyable","601":"Ever since I updated the app, there have been multiple occasions where the screen would stop responding in the middle of a webtoon. The app would then crash or I would have to clear the tab of the app and re-enter the app. This would not always work, however, and the app would end up crashing again. Pls fix this problem because the app is really great and I enjoy using it. It is quite annoying for the app\/screen to suddenly become unresponsive so frequently. I have had this app for over a year now and never experienced any problems until the most recent update.","602":"Every time I see a new WEBTOON I see the time people would put into the drawings and storylines and am inspired to do the same!! Some of them I read when I'm having a hard tome and they lift my spirits! \n\nBut with the new policy coming in I won't feel like reading as many because many of the WEBTOON comics I read includes violence and explicit drawings and I think that its sad that they will have to change their comics just because of censorship. It shouldn't be the app's fault if parents catch their children reading something that has gory, explicit or nude images. The kid should be to blame because they lied their age when you , the app, asked for their age as a warning for the contents. You shouldn't put cut off opportunities for people who put days or even weeks of time and energy in their comics.","603":"I used to always read webtoons back in 2017 and I\u2019ve consistently watched throughout 2018 and 2019. After a while I kinda started reading less and less until I eventually delated the app to free up space on my phone. Recently I downloaded the app to re-read someone of my favorite webtoons and now there\u2019s apparently a daily pass which is completely inconvenient for anyone trying to go back and read old stories. After realizing this I immediately went to the reviews and found that people have been complaining about this for months yet there obviously no major change occurring. It hurts to give such a low review but until this is accommodated my review will stand!!","604":"I really enjoy this app a lot. I love reading all the different types of comics. Though it would be nice to preview comics. If maybe the suggestion page of what you might enjoy reading showed you a preview of what the comic was about like they do on their advertisements. I think it would help readers decide what they\u2019d like to read. Today I was scrolling through Facebook & found an advertisement about Freaking Romance. I read it & liked it so I started reading it on the app. I really enjoy getting previews before I read the comic. Hopefully it could be incorporated!","605":"Ever since I\u2019ve downloaded this app I\u2019ve been obsessed with it! Every time a new comic is up I get super excited. BUT there is one flaw that idk how is happening. At the end or beginning of an episode, there\u2019s this loading screen that takes a couple of seconds to get rid of, but once It\u2019s gone IT SENDS ME TO A WEBSITE? The website is sometime like, adreview or something. Idek but it\u2019s annoying and if webtoon is doing this, then I suggest you PLEASE fix it. If not then my phone probably has a virus lol. I\u2019m giving this 5 stars because it\u2019s probably one of the best apps out there! You guys deserve it <3","606":"I used to use the website, but when I got the app everything was so much.... better. \nMy only problem is that, on the website, there was a very helpful little button that said \u201cwhere I left off\u201d or something like that. The app didn\u2019t have this, so when I was catching up with a long, popular, 280 ep comic or something, I\u2019d have to scroll alllllllllllll the way down to the episode I left off on........ it wasn\u2019t that big of an issue, though, since they still had the \u201cep 1\u201d shortcut :). Really thankful though, this app gave me a lot of great comics >.<","607":"Webtoon is a great platform for so many amazing artists and storytellers to put their work out there. I honestly love webtoon as a service for making it possible for countless incredible comics to be shared with the world. However with this new policy of not allowing NSFW content, regardless of it being censored or not, it restricts creators' ability to present their stories in the most impactful, meaningful way. Numerous creators are being forced to either change entire key events to fit this new policy or to move their comic elsewhere. I understand that there were likely many factors that contributed to this decision being made but this truly feels as if webtoon is turning its back on its creators in favor of being a watered-down \"family friendly\" version of itself. I sincerely hope that this policy be reversed or revised soon.","608":"I love this app, I\u2019ve always used webtoon to help me relax and I\u2019ve been noticing that they have stared to put ads in. First at the end of chapters, but they never interrupted the comic or going to other chapters so I was never bothered by it. But now, every time you exit a chapter\/ episode you get a pop up ads. On the featured pages you get ads, there are ads EVERYWHERE. I know that webtoon needs ads to earn money but they didn\u2019t have to stoop as low as making pop up ads after every chapter. It\u2019s disappointing and they should remove pop up ads from webtoons. I really hope webtoons doesn\u2019t make it so that we have to pay to not see ads because that is even worse. If that happens, I\u2019m done with this app.","609":"The Webtoons themselves are great! Super well done. They are all high quality and really well thought out! I have a lot of favorites. However I HATE THE STUPID COINS AND FAST PASSES. It\u2019s a cheap way to make money for the company, I understand that the company and writers need money, but I guess it\u2019s just not a top priority now. I have waited for them to come out on there own, but it sometimes seems like a ridiculous amount of time. I would get it if it was like a day for each one but a week is a little long. I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind some adds to make it free (NOT A LOT PLEASE OH MY GOSH I HATE ADDS LOL) but enough that you get money and I can binge a whole series haha.","610":"I used to be able to read certain webtoons for free. I never got to finish those webtoons so I went back and realize I had limited access. I didn\u2019t expect some of them to force me to pay money or wait days to read it when the webtoon\u2019s already done; I purposefully stopped reading so I wouldn\u2019t wait for weeks on a cliffhanger. \nThis app has gone to such cheap methods to grab money. My 2 free daily passes got reduced to 1 all of sudden (no reason provided either, but probably this dumb app just doesn\u2019t want to give away their content for free anymore). This app USED to be so much nicer, now it\u2019s just craving for money, and it\u2019s showing.","611":"I love WEBTOON! It\u2019s a good app that has great comics from great creators. However, I\u2019m very upset with the daily passes. I wanted to re-read a romance comic (Untouchable) and I was met with the \u201cyou can unlock this episode for 14 days\u201d bull. I\u2019ve re-read this comic multiple times. This is a completed series. Why am I going to wait to read it when I\u2019ve already waited for the episodes to be completed so I can binge read it all at once? It\u2019s stupid to expect your readers to wait to read a COMPLETED comic. It\u2019s like streaming services making you wait a week to watch a COMPLETED show. This is a feature they need to have change, not only are they going to lose established users of the app but, they\u2019ll lose out on new users exploring the old comics while they wait for their new comics to be updated.","612":"Webtoon is a beautifully made app and there\u2019s really nothing wrong with it! But, sometimes i\u2019m recommend types of webtoons that i don\u2019t really want on my recommended. It\u2019s nice getting recommendations on what I like to read, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it would be really helpful if there could be a, \u201cdon\u2019t recommend,\u201d or \u201cnot interested,\u201d option. Of course all of the comics on this app are made by some of the most talented people, but there might be certain genres like BL that really get on my nerves when i\u2019m recommended them three million times.","613":"I was introduced to Webtoon nearly 4 years ago through an ad lol, I even remember the webtoon \u201cGiant Nerd Boyfriend\u201d on the ad. Because of that one ad I was shown a whole world of creative stories with beautiful drawings! I would recommend this app to everyone ranging from just wanting to read a quick silly blip to lengthy detailed stories. \n\nWhat is a bit annoying though is their new addition of adding Daily Passes to finished webtoons. Sometimes I just want to revisit a story, but it requires coins to do so. \n\nAnyway, overall great app, totally recommend to anyone of any age tbh.","614":"During quarantine I\u2019ve been looking for a fun app or game to use, and someone recommended this app to me. I LOVE this app. I can\u2019t think of any flaw that bothers me. \nIt\u2019s entertaining, full of creativity, and has almost any genre you can think of! Because this app let\u2019s creators make LIVE content for the reader, you are able to enjoy the latest stories. This app also has a wide verity of art styles you can choose from. Overall I love this app that has entertained me throughout quarantine, and I would recommend you to get if you haven\u2019t already.","615":"Everything about the app is amazing the stories are always fulfilling and creative and it is a treat to read them. My one complaint is the reward ads. It\u2019s not that I hate watching them, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t watch them. I have tried multiple times to watch an ad so that I can read an early episode, but they don\u2019t work. I even tried deleting the app, but it still didn\u2019t work. This just really frustrates me and if you could do something about it I would be forever grateful. Nonetheless, I still love the app.","616":"It\u2019s a great app with SO MANY possibilities! All types of comics, all different styles, all so many unique things about them all! I could go on and on about how much I like it, however, I\u2019d rather just cut to the chase. My one problem is that you should be able to upload comics on any device. It might be nitpicking, but it\u2019s annoying that I downloaded this app to read comics, AND make them, but only get one. It was a bit of a letdown, but I still love the app. Hopefully you can come up with a solution soon, because I\u2019d really love to make my own things as there\u2019s pretty much no other apps just dedicated to comics.","617":"Dint get me wrong, I LOVE THIS APP! I am currently reading a series, and the first day I was able to read everything. But now it\u2019s telling me I have to wit a day to read the next episode. And then 14 days to be able to read another.  The coin thing is so stupid. I\u2019m not going to pay for coins to read. I\u2019m reading \u201cNot Even Bones\u201d and there is no way I\u2019m gonna be able to wait a month, just to be able to read 3 episodes. We should be able to like- watch a video and ear coins.\nSo much easier. And makes everyone happier. But I\u2019m not paying, just wanna make that clear.\nBut other than that, I have no complaints. It\u2019s a great app with a big problem.","618":"I love this app a lot for reading comics in my spare time. I wish there was an easier way of going to the next page instead of pressing the left or right arrows & I wish there was dark mode since a lot of apps are compatible with it. I also would love it if we could be able to like or comment on episodes we have downloaded. And I wish Line Webtoon could get the same interface and the same comics as Naver Webtoon because i feel like people who cannot understand Korean are at a disadvantage and go to Naver Webtoon because there are more comics.","619":"I love this app but there is one thing that is not being done. I have seen very inappropriate comments from a certain user and saying inappropriate, sexual comments. There are underage kids who read this and even if you report the comment, it does not get removed. I see the same user over and over bullying other users and saying very inappropriate things. The user is clearly violations \u201cThe terms of agreement \u201c since bulling and saying INAPPROPRIATE things in the comments for all to see is unacceptable. I hope Webtoons take the appropriate action and would monitor better the comment section , and kick out those who cross the line. I give it a 1 star because this is not something that should be overlooked. Hope there is a solution to the matter.","620":"Okay so to start off I love Webtoons because it has introduced me to many of my favorite stories and characters. Webtoons is also a great platform for new artists to get their start on creating and writing, but due to the new policy many artists, including new ones, have had their creative freedom taken away, yes I do understand as to why this policy has taken place but I believe there is a better way to manage the NSFW scenes in many comics and I agree with what this other review said, there could just be age restrictions. So other then that Webtoons is great and it would be a five star but the policy is holding me back.","621":"Dear creators of WEBTOON, \n\nI don\u2019t like that you have to use coins to read more episodes. I am a kid that likes reading comics or picture books and when I saw the ad for WEBTOON I immediately downloaded it. I found a story that I liked and started reading it, and now I really like it. I spent a lot of time reading the story because it is interesting, but now I have to pay coins to read more chapters of the story which you have to buy the coins first which I can\u2019t because my parents won\u2019t let me. So I was wondering if you could ether make it so you do not have to pay coins to read more chapters of a story or be able to watch ads for coins. \n\nSincerely a WEBTOON fan","622":"This app is amazing! There\u2019s hundreds of comics to read that have been written with care and not just predictable, all comics have a amazing storyline too. And the comics are SOOO suspenseful. Which I like in a comic. But here\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t like, I made a account on the app but when I sign in so I can subscribe to comics, the email box when I pressed sign in it said my email was wrong, I even made a new account but still, it said my email was wrong when I wanted to sign in. But otherwise this app is perfect it\u2019s comics are also amazing and I do recommend this app. \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd2a","623":"I\u2019m not one to rate a lot of apps but I felt like WEBTOON deserves after I\u2019ve had it for roughly two years now. The app itself is near flawless with the only real complaint I could have would be the incredibly slow download times for offline viewing, and that the app has to be on that single page. You can\u2019t go on another app or read something else while it\u2019s downloading. You just sit there and wait. The app does excel in basically every other department. There are no features I think should be implemented or necessarily taken out. Just a solid all around app. 9.5\/10","624":"Yoooooooo I love this app don\u2019t change anything leave everything where it is please don\u2019t change it. Some people complain it\u2019s inappropriate yeah it is but there are more people that want to read and see this stuff than the people that don\u2019t. What I\u2019m trying to say is leave it alone yes continue to update make it better but leave the inappropriate stuff alone all of I\u2019ve subscribed to are inappropriate and some are so dope,cool,etc and I don\u2019t want to see them taken down so can you please not change anything","625":"I honestly love the app and use it quite often but I got on thing to do stop with the ads for the app sorry if it\u2019s rude but I\u2019ve seen ads for this app the make great stories look terrible there are amazing and brilliant comics on there but the ads for the app make many people who might wanna checkout the app back off cause they\u2019re that bad either change your ads or stop because they\u2019re having the opposite affect of gaining new users and are making everyone think the apps terrible if I hadn\u2019t downloaded the app before seeing one of the ads I probably wouldn\u2019t have downloaded it at all","626":"Being an active user of Webtoons for at least a couple of years, I can faithfully say that Webtoons is a great app! Never have I said \u201cOh, I wish Webtoons could do x y z\u201d I honestly think that Webtoons is a perfect platform and that I\u2019m more than grateful for it. I\u2019m most satisfied with the fact that it\u2019s free and that we\u2019re able to support the author\u2019s creations through likes and comments. Often I find that each Webtoon has a great community of readers who love the comic and don\u2019t mind showing that love through likes and comments. Ultimately, Webtoons is a great app that I\u2019ll always cherish","627":"I\u2019ve used WEBTOON for a very long time, I love the stories on it and how you can share them all over. And I like reading them and am always excited when a new one comes out. Although recently I ran out of the coins I purchased so I went to buy some new ones. I bought a .99 cent 10 coin purchase but, it never gave me my coins. I refreshed but it said that there was an error and I should wait but it still charged me. I was stupid and decided to try again and the same thing happen so now I\u2019ve spent 2 dollars on 0 coins that have not shown up, I\u2019ve restarted my phone, refreshed and redownloaded the app but nothing is working!!! I need help bc I wasted money and now I can\u2019t read my story:(","628":"I love this app there are so many fun stories to read and they are very interesting I don\u2019t mind the fast past I understand that the authors need their time to do their work also I recommend these: True beauty, Devil Number No.4, Down to Earth, To love your Enemy, Nice to meet you, Love Yoo, Edith, Midnight poppy land, Age matters, My deepest secret, Death of a pop star, The kiss bet, Brass and sass, ok thanks that\u2019s all I have to say remember download WEBTOON it\u2019s a really good app if your here to hate on it then please don\u2019t write a review if your here to say can you fix something then you can go ahead and write a review ok bye now","629":"I\u2019ve been with WEBTOON for a really long time. It has amazing stories and authors, and really helps new creators with Canvas. I can\u2019t tell you how many tears of laughter, joy, and sadness I\u2019ve shed with WEBTOON. However, the new update brought on a whole new series of problems. I like that the we can still support the creators after the series is completed, but I don\u2019t like how after you buy a fast pass for a story it locks again after 14 days. The fast pass should make the episodes remain open. Besides that I would definitely recommend the app.","630":"I have been using WEBTOON since 2014 and have loved every minute until fast pass. I understand the need to make money but now I have to wait 118 days just to finish a WEBTOON that I wanted to binge read. I\u2019d prefer even an ad after every WEBTOON over this. I am upset and want to give this amazing app 5 stars but I am unable to after fast pass. I don\u2019t have time to read something every day and only get a small snippet because, let\u2019s face it, most WEBTOONs are small so now I\u2019m resorting to look up other websites in order to read these masterpieces. I have almost stopped using WEBTOON to read and just browse it then look up the WEBTOON on another site. \n\nFAST PASS IS HURTING YOUR APP.","631":"The app itself is sleek, smooth and reliable (enough for an extra star) but they\u2019ve recently begun hiding their most popular completed series behind a daily pass or paywall system, meaning you can\u2019t binge them anymore.  Any attempt to binge read would add up quite quickly.  I\u2019m all for supporting artists, but don\u2019t have that much free cash lying around and question how much of the money actually goes to the artists themselves. I haven\u2019t found that answer online yet.  \n\nWorth mentioning these same series used to be free to read, so IMO they\u2019ve taken away features. I\u2019ll probably wait for my current series to wrap up and then phase off the app unless they get enough complaints to reverse this decision.","632":"I absolutely love this app!! I mean this is where I can escape from the real world, so thank you, creators, for making this app... Although I DO have some recommendations... Firstly, you should have a way to reply to your replies, (you understand what I\u2019m saying?) like, you can mention someone and they see that or just.. yeah\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nSecond, you should have something to say that a series is complete... and maybe you can follow other people than just people writing the stories? \nAnyway, those are my recommendations! Thank you guys SO SO much for making this app!!! I hope you like the recommendations I gave\u2764\ufe0f","633":"I really love Webtoon. I like reading a bunch of amazing comics and seeing everyone\u2019s art styles. The only problem I have is the \u201cwatch ad to read episode\u201d thing. I don\u2019t mind the fact that i have to watch the ad because it helps the creators get some more money but  the ads just don\u2019t play. I\u2019ll switch from wifi to cellular, I\u2019ll close out the app, and wait but i always get the same message \u201cUnable to load ad reward. please try again later\u201d It\u2019s really frustrating because I want to read the episode to support the creators (and for enjoyment of course) but the ads just won\u2019t play.","634":"This app is the best, not only is it easy to use, but free to use as well.\nUnlike other comic apps, this one lets you read chapters for free, instead of paying coins for chapters already uploaded. \nThey do make you pay coins for chapters that haven\u2019t been uploaded, but only if you want to read them without waiting, and that\u2019s something I really do appreciate about this app. I hope they don\u2019t change the system, because I don\u2019t mind waiting a week for a new chapter rather than buy chapters ahead of time, and have to wait longer.","635":"I don\u2019t really like to read.. it would have to be a really interesting book for me to read it. Webtoon completely changed my perspective on books, the stories are extremely interesting and addictive. I can guarantee that you\u2019d be able to find a story that draws your attention. I currently LOVE \u201cLore Olympus\u201d... the only thing that bugs me, is that when you run out of coins, it takes a whole week for you to be able to read the next chapter, of that book. Otherwise I recommend webtoon and I really hope you find the comment helpful.","636":"This app was great in the beginning. It was different, humble not greedy. Recently though they developed this coming system which is really annoying. You have to pay to read the newest chapter now, not cool. In the beginning it was DEFINITELY 5 stars but greed got the best of Webtoon. They aren\u2019t allowing certain \u201cinappropriate\u201d content and I don\u2019t like that. I\u2019ve been in webtoon for years now and I\u2019m so disappointed, now it\u2019s just like all the other apps. Honestly at this rate it won\u2019t be very hard to just ditch this app and read them online like many others are doing just so webtoon won\u2019t make as much money. This better be fixed soon or I\u2019ll just have to leave like I left episode choose your story when the new animations came along. -sincerely your very old user","637":"I enjoyed using WEBTOON, it\u2019s a great way to access quality content without having to pay. That being said I\u2019m really disappointed to hear that I might not be able to view\/read content from some of my favorite artists because their content doesn\u2019t follow the newest, strictest guidelines I\u2019ve seen. I really don\u2019t want to have to try and find them on other, possibly shadier, lower quality sites. Enforcing these new rules has the potential to reduce traffic for some very popular creators, to a point where some may be forced to find new sites to post on. This was a nice way to read free content, but now I\u2019m not so sure. Hopefully something can get figured out.","638":"Hello hello, I truly love Webtoons. But the daily pass is seriously annoying. Why do I need to wait to read a series I\u2019ve already read? While it\u2019s understandable for new series or series that People haven\u2019t read but for series that people have already read they shouldn\u2019t need a daily pass. I enjoy rereading certain comics but I don\u2019t enjoy reading them one episode a day. I would really appreciate it if you made the daily passes for series people haven\u2019t read yet instead of series that have already been read.","639":"I absolutely love webtoon, I have become addicted to subzero and buy coins more often than I buy groceries! However, I hate that there is no one time pay option or subscription option to get a better version of it, to say give you unlimited fast pass coins or exclusive raffles and contests. Instead you are paying the same thing over and over again with no better option to benefit both parties. It\u2019s not a problem really just a suggestion for future updates. Again, I\u2019m obsessed with this app!","640":"So I absolutely love webtoon! I downloaded it yesterday and I\u2019m already hooked on a couple series. However I don\u2019t like the fact that you can only get to a certain point before it saying you need to pay. I love webtoon and would give it 5 stars but I can\u2019t read as much as I would want because of the pass thingy. It should be free to read because I want to continue reading the series but can\u2019t because I don\u2019t wish to pay for coins. Please make an unpair removing that as many people do not like the limit on it. Thank you for reading, and I hope you will consider getting rid of it.","641":"I love this app in almost every way. I am very invested in a couple of stories and it really calms me down and gives me something to do, especially since quarantine. There is a big problem that I have with the app though. 7 days is entirely to long to wait for one episode. Only being able to read one every week makes it very frustrating and makes the app almost seem pointless. I do not have a lot of money so I cannot buy coins. I understand the the app needs to make money some how but I just personally think one week is way too long. Maybe at least twice a week.","642":"I LOVE every part about this app. I really liked the story the cursed princess club. It is all about beauty within. A boy isn\u2019t worth it if they make you cry. I feel so bad for my girl Gwen though. Fredrick was a total jerk to her. The way the other cursed princesses stood up for her touched even the deadest of souls. I hope to hear back from you guys for making this amazing app. I deeply thank you for making it. What are some of your favorite stories? And what comedy stories do you recommend? I finished the cursed princess club story in less then two days it was so good.","643":"I love WEBTOON so much. It\u2019s truly one of my favorite things. I\u2019ve spent weekends just binging series and catching up to the current season and it\u2019s super fun to do. But...I do have a few things I think could be a little better. 1) I don\u2019t think there should be such a low limit of webtoons I can subscribe to. I can only subscribe to (I think) 100 canvas webtoons and I reached my limit. I have resorted to screenshots of comics to look at later. 2) Canvas creators should be able to have music with their comic. They should have all of the perks that the Originals creators have. If these problems were fixed then I would give WEBTOON 5 stars.","644":"I love the app! However as of today the coins in my account have disappeared this is not a big deal since I only had 10 from the last free coin event (I think this was the first free coin event? I\u2019m not sure tho). Not the current one. But, it\u2019s worrying because Incase I buy coins I would not like them to randomly disappear !!! However, you don\u2019t need coins to read everything\u2019s free and they have complete well done stories ! And not just short ones :) I love the app and recommended to very one they have a wide variety of genres (i.e action comedy romance)","645":"Personally I love web tune with this new update in its policy has broken my heart. Web tune is awesome and I love the app like no other but the BL content is starting to be un fun to read. The new policy states stuff about the in NSFW stuff against the policy which means removing mature content which is drive a lot of people crazy including me. I have nothing against his new policy but web tune is starting to decrease my liking of actually going on the app. I hope that the policy gets changed back to where it was because I Kinda do miss my old stories and how their originated. If it doesn\u2019t I\u2019m still gonna like that the only reason I gave it to start was because the policy everything else is great. Keep up the good work and remember the policy thing.\ud83e\udd17","646":"I absolutely love WEBTOON! The only issue is that they made a new rule where the author has to make their comic kid friendly and it honestly kills a lot of the story. The app used to have a reminder that what you were reading was 18+ but now they just banned it. It\u2019s super disappointing and it frustrates a lot of the authors. Some authors have had to basically redraw\/rewrite their entire comic because most of their plot was taken down. It would be better if they came up with a different way to solve the underage issue. Instead they should make you put in your birthdate or something. WEBTOON is definitely an amazing app with super talented authors but it would be so much better if they changed the new policy back how it used to be. PLEASE STOP THE NEW POLICY!!!! :(","647":"Most people don\u2019t really like to read because they can\u2019t find interesting stories but the stories on the app consider what you like and they Take recommendations and you just get which I love this app is like you subscribe you can call me and you can basically had to make friends on this app and on other reading apps that usually have to pay you do not have to pay for anything on this app it\u2019s absolutely positively free which I love and plus I notify you on which stories you like which is really awesome so that\u2019s my review\ud83e\udd17","648":"Probably the best comic app I have had. If you're new you can binge all you want without worrying about ads like other apps. \nI have probably had this app for 2 or 3 years and you won\u2019t get bored because they release new series almost every week. They even give you chances to have free coins without using money, you just have to complete the steps and it\u2019s really easy to get them done. The series update quite frequently as well, a new episode every week or every three days depending on if it\u2019s a translation or not. \u2764\ufe0f","649":"I\u2019ve had this app and my account for a long time but today when I went on the app It wanted me to log in but I didn\u2019t have the same email and couldn\u2019t remember it big deal I\u2019ll just make a new account and subscribe to my comics again but when I press subscribe after making a new one it says I need to log in when I just did this so I end up doing this 20 times I love the app and the comics but now I have to search for the comics I read every time I want to read when I have an account with my new email I don\u2019t know if this is just happening to me but I\u2019d love if it could be fixed I love this app and I don\u2019t want to have to get a different on because of login and sign up problems","650":"Love this app! But.. the main thing that frustrates me is the fast pass. Once I\u2019ve read some of the the episodes in a comic, I\u2019d have to wait a week for a new episode even though the owner of the comic has already made that episode (you\u2019d have to pay money for coins to unlock episodes so it releases earlier) I know WEBTOON wants to make money on this app, but I suggest unlocking the episodes more earlier. Such as maybe 4 or 3 episodes a week? (Because some ppl are poor like me lol). And I gotta tell you, reading an episode with a cliffhanger and then waiting a week for the other episode to come out is not fun.","651":"I would give it a five star if the download system wasn\u2019t so bad. It is the worst download system I have ever seen it\u2019s not that it\u2019s really slow it\u2019s an okay pace but what really annoys me is that you have to stay on the loading screen or it will stop downloading completely and you have to start downloading the chapter all over again and it doesn\u2019t even properly download them they don\u2019t load when I\u2019m offline even when they are not past the 30 day limit. I really like a lot of the stories and it pretty easy to use but the download system is such a downer I really hope you fix it so I can give you a five star.","652":"WEBTOON is phenomenal with so many great and unique series. However I have one big problem with it and it has to do with completed series. With WEBTOON you can no longer read completed series without having to pay per episode or get a free pass per day. This would be understandable to get new content for a ongoing series, but in a completed one it is just greedy. I love noblesse and wanted to read it again but to my surprise it was stuck behind a pay wall. Please WEBTOON allow us to watch completed series in peace just like you would do in an anime and just like you used to","653":"This is a small problem if fixed there would be a much bigger inflow of artists making art on your app. That small problem is that people should be able to make content from iPad and iPhone it only being two electronics is limiting artist. I got an account thinking maybe then I could make a comic but I was disappointed that I couldn\u2019t do so. Only if you could change it to where if people get an account the can make a comic no matter the electronic would be such an improvement besides that I would in fact give it a five star for the good build and the amazing set up. There are very good comics. The app is good.","654":"I have had this application for awhile now and it\u2019s really good and easy to use. Now, the only problem I\u2019ve seen is that some writers deceive the readers really easy and don\u2019t seem to care for our opinions but also nobody does nothing about it. They will write a story and categorize it under something to make ppl read it and then they will change the story out of nowhere. There\u2019s categories for a reason and not everybody likes the same thing so that\u2019s why ppl search for an specific category. It\u2019s even worse when we pay for coins to read these stories and at the end from a \u201cromance\u201d it ends up on a \u201ctragedy\u201d... they are taking the readers for granted even though we are the ones that support their work!","655":"So I absolutely love this app. I love all of the stories but lately on my phone it has been acting weird. I thought maybe it was my WiFi or maybe my phone. So I reset it turned it off for a bit. It was still acting weird while everything else on my phone was fine. It takes forever to load, when I click on something it does not click. I have been having a hard time reading on it. So I deleted the app and reinstalled it and it was still acting weird I have no idea why. I haven\u2019t had any problems before this but it is still a good app!","656":"I really really love this app, especially the sheer diversity of the artists on this platform and the amazing stories that they come up with. I have one problem and it\u2019s the \u201cagree with comment\u201d or \u201clike\u201d button in the comments section. Whatever you want to call it, it\u2019s too small \ud83d\ude05. My fat thumbs can\u2019t quite hit the button so i\u2019ll be stuck in a loop of accidentally opening the comment section when i just want to like the comment. It gets unreasonably frustrating. . . otherwise, i\u2019m addicted to this platform and i love it :)","657":"This app is a really good AP you have the option to fast pass or not but your new episode will update there is amazing comics and art you can chose which category of story you want and the best thing is what ever you do the app is not trying to Gary you to buy or pay for something this app is so good that is you have it for a  certain amount of time the give you free coins which you can use to fast pass!! I wold 10\/10 recommended this app it is free and there are very few adds and most of the adds are just promoting the top WEBTOONS","658":"I tried to download this about 6 months ago and was confused on how it worked. (lol) so when my friend told me to download it I gave it another try and fell in love. Here are my top three favorites. Unordinary is my favorite talking about a nobody day highschooler named John and \u201cabilities\u201d as Uru-Chan calls them. Then there\u2019s true beauty. The most popular webtoon on the app. It\u2019s a very well written story with a very good plot. And lastly, the kiss bet. It\u2019s not the most popular but it shows the love life of 18 year old \u201csubway girl\u201d and how she\u2019s never even had a kiss. She\u2019s has three boys in a love \u201csquare\u201d? And a good plot.","659":"Remember without customers your app would tank, so instead of following corporate greed how about listening to your customers. The new policy\u2019s are going to have most of us leaving this app then what? Your ratings go down,  nobody is going to pay ridiculous amount for something you claimed free in the beginning, that\u2019s why you had a great followings and ratings. Now you\u2019re going to leave most of these popular artist high and dry for trying to scam most of the customers out of money. Reminder no parent is going to pay for their 9 year old to read comics they\u2019d rather have them enjoy something free and fun, instead of an app that became rather greedy. Just start listening to your customers. And why did I randomly get logged out of my account?","660":"Okay I do fast pass for UnOrdinary and it worked fine last week. I got read the new episode, but it says the app detects a device and asks if I want to register it. I say okay, but there\u2019s only one device to register which is my phone which has been registered with the app since 2019. I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not allowed to read the fast pass episodes, but the other episodes I can read no problem. This is really bothering me because there\u2019s no other device to register. Is there someone trying to hack or do I just not understand some new feature of the app?","661":"I loved this app before the new rules, now half of my comics that I follow are paused or completely abandoned because they can\u2019t post the kind of art work that they used to be able to do. And let me get something straight, you are not the only platform for these comics, you are pushing away creators who are simply going to other platforms and losing reader along with them. My fav comics are now relying entirely on patreon. This is inconvenient for readers because although we love the authors we came to WEBTOON because it was free. I love these authors and creators but I\u2019m not going to pay to read smut, no matter how good it is. So now I\u2019m no longer reading these authors at all, so you made an author lose a reader and your app lose a user. I\u2019m done with WEBTOON until you fix this.","662":"Jack of all trades? Hardly. This app, under the help of its hardworking development team, has easily become one of the most polished and alluring apps on the market. Not only does it provide endless entertainment with exciting cartoons to read, it surpasses many of the other reading apps in that its interface is very bright, user-friendly \u2014 representing the majority of its library and setting the reader into that mood for relaxed reading.\n\nThe app even gives back to the creators and from my perspective, definitely deserves the rating it has today.","663":"I absolutely love love the comics. However if you get a new phone or have to re download the app on current phone. It is absolutely ridiculous. This happened to me not once but twice. It says gmail not registered yet if i go to sign up it says it is. If i go to reset password it sends to the email i am trying  to sign in with! Yet it wont let me log in with it. Yet thats not the most upsetting part. Since i cant log in i just end up making a new account. And guess what i lose all of my comics I\u2019m reading and i lose the place i was reading in the comics. Some comics i just cant ever find again. Then on the other hand sometimes i just give up on trying to find my spot so I\u2019ll start somewhere random where i know I haven\u2019t read. I am very very upset!","664":"I love WEBTOON and enjoy reading all the different stories out there. Recently they\u2019ve added a feature where, for some comics, if you watch a short video you can view the newest episode. I am usually okay with this cause I know these ads can help the creators but 8\/10 times I agree to watch the video and it doesn\u2019t work. It says the reward can\u2019t be loaded right now and to try again later. It\u2019s just frustrating cause I want to both read the comic and support the author but I can\u2019t because the ad won\u2019t load.","665":"Honestly this app was great before and I always loved it but recently it\u2019s been going under a lot of changes. When the introduction of coins came I didn\u2019t really care because I like to let my updates build up and come back to read them but these new daily passes have got to be the worst update I\u2019ve ever seen a comic app add. If the comic is finished and has 100+ chapters why am I forced to wait everyday to read the next story or pay for it? It seems that this app is starting to become money hungry in a sense (and yes I understand the creators deserve to be compensated but not like this). If this is going to spread and all WEBTOONS will be like this all I can say is don\u2019t even bother to download it unless your willing to wait everyday to read one chapter or pay.","666":"Good concept in theory, but it\u2019s annoying to have so few language options available and to not be able to see multiple languages. I don\u2019t want to see only English comics or only Spanish comics and have to go through a process to change between the two. I want one screen where I can look at comics from all the languages I know. Even more so because often things are lost in translation and I am not a fan. I\u2019d much rather where you have a list and you can select all the languages you want to see or a filter option for languages when searching. That would be infinitely more useful.","667":"I honestly like WEBTOONs a lot and it has a lot of great stories but I\u2019m starting to see that it\u2019s going down the same path that episode did. They started by having fast passes where you paid to read ahead (not a big deal). But now they have put a limit on how much of a completed story you can read before you have to pay to read more in a day. I think it will one day reach a point where you have to pay for every single chapter of a story, which will annoy the readers and cause them to lose interest on the app. So even though it\u2019s a good app today the fact that they\u2019re limiting binge reading will be their downfall.","668":"Daily pass was a mistake. \nI support all of the efforts to give creators money but the revenue was already coming from fast pass! I\u2019m so sad that this app has made a turn for the worst by only allowing people to read an episode per day for a completed comic! \nNext thing you know the ongoing originals will also only be available with a daily pass. That would mark the end of the webtoon app and pirating would be the way that most people get their daily fill of stories! Please remove the daily pass as it does not benefit the readers nor the webtoon app from profiting. You are only driving away your customers...and I know I won\u2019t be reading anymore of the completed comics with a daily pass.","669":"I had just started using the app and was reading \u201cthe gamer\u201d at around chapter 56 when suddenly it crashed (everything was working very well and was the best reading experience I\u2019ve had) I tried opening the app around 10 times and everytime it would slightly open for 1 second and close itself , after this I decided to delete the app and redownload it and still it kept crashing except this time it opened for around 20 seconds and after that back to 1 second crashes . After this I decided to shut down my iPhone 11 and turn it on and still nothing I dont know what happened and I don\u2019t know how to fix this , the app was amazing and this suddenly happend","670":"Love this app. I anxiously await every single comic that I have subscribed to and have previously bought coins just to support the app and it\u2019s creators.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWhat has frustrated me to no end is when I get logged out for no apparent reason and my account gets deleted, which means I would have to find and resubscribe to all of the comics, and coins previously bought have been lost, which is why I have been looking into other platforms. This has happened multiple times and I KNOW it wasn\u2019t because I was banned. I rarely if ever posted comments on works and they were always praising the authors. Please fix and resolve this issue.","671":"I love this app with my whole heart, but recently I\u2019ve been having problems. I saw in the reviews I\u2019m not the only but it freezes a lot when I\u2019m trying to find new stories or shows a white screen, as well as when I want to look at the other categories besides recently read like subscribed, comments, etc. it won\u2019t let me click on them. I\u2019m not giving up on this app, I\u2019m to dedicated and addicted to the stories I\u2019m reading, I just hope that you can fix it for the sake of the readers and more importantly the Authors.","672":"This app is an amazing app and I like that it\u2019s in English because I\u2019m Cuban and I know English and Spanish and those are the only languages I know so I am very limited I am hooked and I\u2019ll wait as much time as I need for a new episode because the series I\u2019m reading is the best thing I\u2019ve read in a while! So I think this app can make people read and the illustrations I love them so cool! I am very grateful the creator created this app! I think everyone in the world should download all types of webtoon! I\u2019ve only had it for three days and I\u2019m already hooked! Thank you so much!","673":"I\u2019ve been on WEBTOON for a couple of years now and love it. Right now, I\u2019m running into an issue of where it says there\u2019s no internet connection, please try again later. So, I tried again later, still happening. It\u2019s been going on for weeks and weeks now. I mean, I have internet connections and have decent signal. Well, it did say there was a server issue and idk when it will be fixed. So, creators of webtoon, can you try to fix this please. Please and thank you. That would be appreciated \ud83d\ude42. Cause I love webtoons so much!","674":"After downloading Webtoon last year, I thought it couldn\u2019t get any better. But it did! The slick stylish look the app has is so appealing. The unlimited webtoons of various genres always leaves you wanting for more. Not only would you be supporting the young artists who uses this app as their platform, but you also get to enjoy romance, thrillers, fantasy, and so much more. Seriously, Webtoon is extremely worth it, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime. I seriously suggest downloading it and start reading any Webtoons you like at your fingertips!","675":"I absolutely loved this app and enjoyed reading comics on it all the time. However, with the new policies that they have established I find it hard to continue using this app. Not only did it force authors to take down content that I'm sure they worked very hard on, but the removed content also took away from the stories themselves. I thought WEBTOON was a place for artists to express and share their work freely, helping them gain recognition. Even authors that put 18+ warnings and etc. on their stories still had to remove content. I know that many other WEBTOON users will agree with me when I say that these policies are unfair to not only the authors that have chosen to upload their work on this app, but also the fans of the stories that they've made.","676":"I\u2019ve been reading the comics and I love them. But ever since the new policy for authors regarding certain comics I am not happy of the changes. I love every story that I\u2019ve read so far and I know the meaning and hard work the author has to go through. I\u2019m no expert but I can imagine how difficult it is and besides still doing their daily lives. No judging here at all but please don\u2019t make difficult for them. They already do so much for us, the fans that follow them. Is not fair, This new policy is changing the concept of the stories and I don\u2019t like it at all!!! I will end taking off the app and follow my authors anywhere so they won\u2019t have to struggle with their beautiful art and stories!! Authors and fans stick together!!","677":"No ads they have all your favorite stories any type of genre as you want they have all interesting story so Maisie think that you get to travel with the authorize it going with the story is so good you really have to download this app if you don\u2019t have it I feel sorry for you once I download this it has everything I was looking for anything and everything I was so happy with all the stories and I couldn\u2019t wait and they didn\u2019t stop in that came naturally in the always have a new selection it\u2019s amazing believe me!!!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f","678":"I really really love this app. It\u2019s amazing without a doubt but not letting the sexual content on here is honestly what\u2019s making me a bit frustrated. Because then the authors would have to post it on another app and then I would have to download that app just because there\u2019s no mature content on webtoon. Which if you would let mature content on webtoon it would make the app so much more better. Yes it\u2019s just for people 18 and older and only for people older than 18. So there should be some type of thing that would not let people younger than 18 not look at the \u201cmature content\u201d but yes I like this app it would just be better if they let 18+ content on here.","679":"I\u2019ve been on this app since 2016 and I\u2019ve never had any issues with it up until now, if I\u2019m being nit picky I don\u2019t like daily passes but that\u2019s a totally separate topic. Since the latest update I can get the app to load to main page with all my subscribed to comics however whenever I open up a comic it shows me a white screen and the only buttons that appear are rate and subscribe... I can\u2019t get back to the main page and I\u2019m stuck there until I close out the app. Even when I reload the app I still get the same issue and it has only started to occur since the last update...","680":"I honestly love this app, but one thing it includes bothers me. Ive been on and off of WEBTOON for a while, so my comics have piled up. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\u2019t remember which comic I haven\u2019t read the updates to. I\u2019ll scroll down to the bottom of the WEBTOONs I read, and check if I\u2019ve read the updates for it, and every time I exit a comics page, it scrolls all the way up to the top of my feed, which is super annoying. If it\u2019s fixed, then I\u2019ll give 5 stars, but it\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019ll leave the comics till later to avoid spending time digging through them. Ty.","681":"Ik everyone is giving so much flack to webtoon because of their new policy, but if it weren't for the policy, some young innocent children could be reading content that they shouldn't be seeing no at a young age. If you really want to see that chapter get in contact with the author on Instagram or just search it up online. It is not fair for you to start hating an amazing app just because they added a policy that helps protect the people reading it.\n\nWebtoon is an amazing app with amazing stories and I definitely recommend downloading this app and going to their website.","682":"Basically I enjoyed this app so much!! And I definitely appreciate that WEBTOON is giving a chance to small creators to earn some money by having viewers watch ads! I have been doing so with no issue, until today! I was trying to watch an ad and it had me reset my advertising identifier, which I promptly did, once doing so it still wouldn\u2019t let me watch the ad! Saying the same exact thing, the app is updated to the newest version for me, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it. If possible please tell me if I can!! I have no clue if this is a bug or not, but I\u2019m pretty sure it is.","683":"I love this app and all the manhwa on it. However, there are a lot of completed series that have been paywalls when they haven\u2019t been before. I\u2019ve read through and followed a few of the completed series and now I can\u2019t go back to reread them for memories because I can only read one a day. It\u2019s really annoying and could easily be fixed by just leaving daily pass episodes unlocked or if you have already read the toon once you don\u2019t have to repass it. Hive is a great example. Fantastic series and now it\u2019s completed and daily passed. It wasn\u2019t daily passed while it was being made and for the first few years of it being completed. I think this is a pretty simple request and would love to see it implemented. Thanks!","684":"Okay, before this daily pass thing I was willing to sell my soul to this app, but now I\u2019d have to pay to unlock episodes for completed series. The other option besides paying, is to wait one day for an episode, but some webtoons have over 200 episodes. So if I waited every day for a new episode, it would take me over half of a year to read a webtoon. I understand why this feature is on here, and I really do appreciate all of the hard work that the artists put into these webtoons, but I just really don\u2019t like this new feature, and looking at other reviews, other people don\u2019t either.","685":"There are a few series that I really love on this app, but that\u2019s it. There is a lack of series compared to less official sites (you know what I mean) and a lot less variety. I often feel like a lot of the stories are the same repeated character tropes, but that\u2019s just my opinion. \n\nI prefer reading completed series and binging them in a few days. This app doesn\u2019t have many completed series that are too my taste in the first place. But they then introduced this daily pass thing that basically makes it impossible to binge without paying. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised nor am I necessarily angry. I now only use the app every two months or so. I am only waiting for the series that I\u2019ve been dedicated to to upload enough chapters for me to read. Once they end, I\u2019ll probably delete the app. (I\u2019ve already found new places to read webtoons :P)\n\nOverall: \n- not enough series to my taste\n- not enough completed webtoons\n- binging being limited is a no no\n- doesn\u2019t stand up against competitors (that are completely free btw)","686":"I absolutely love this app! I can read many comics and enjoy all the interesting stories people have created! Though...there\u2019s one thing. I get that the app consist of its own soundtracks depending on the story, but it\u2019s so hard to listen to music when the app just shuts it off as soon as I start reading a story. I would really like to enjoy reading a story while also listening to my own music. I don\u2019t know if this is the app or the phone. But it gets pretty annoying sitting in silence while ready...because I like to have background music. Other than that...! I enjoy the app a lot!","687":"I love this app already and I only had it for 2 days! I\u2019m excited for the new episodes for Cursed Princess Club. CPC is why I downloaded Webtoon! Webtoon has funny, romantic, and dramatic comics\/shows you can see! This is one of my FAVORITE apps now! But, I have a suggestion. Can you please make some comics more kid-friendly? Like, since i\u2019m reading the cursed princess club, can you not include lots of swearing or innapropriate things? I know it doesn\u2019t have that, but I just want to say it now so my favorite series won\u2019t be innapropriate. But still, you should get this app! It\u2019s the best! \ud83d\ude03","688":"Some of the reviews about coins, are complaining about having to pay. Coins are used to read episodes early before they are officially released. Paying for coins helps support the author(s), besides free updates on featured stories are available every week, or more often depending on the comic. If you don't want to wait for new episodes, read some of the stories that have already been finished(There's a section for finished stories). Anyway, I like most of the featured\/official\/published stories. I'm pretty much addicted \ud83d\uddff","689":"Beautiful art with funny and relatable storylines. Large variety of genres to choose from. Fun and easy to use anywhere. Great way to spend your leisure time. I would recommend trying this app if you like reading or watching movies\/shows.\n\nAlthough, the 100 discover webtoons limit? I mean is that absolute necessary? It sounds bizarre like you\u2019re never going to reach that point, but once you become an active reader... you\u2019re bound to hit that wall. I hope that issue can be resolved, because it would make the experience x10 more pleasurable.\n\nAlso idea: dark mode?","690":"I love WEBTOON so much! I like the comics it has and I\u2019m so happy I downloaded it. I only have one problem. Downloading. I got that you don\u2019t want your content being stolen but only being able to download something once? I think that there should be a way to download it again. Like maybe after a month of not having being able to download it again? Like what if someone has had this app for years and they can\u2019t download something and they have wifi problems because they start college or something. That\u2019s my only problem, otherwise thank you so much!!","691":"so i only got this app a couple days ago because my friend is rly into webtoons and i finally got around to trying it out. I like that it\u2019s free and easy to use and i enjoy the stories. I downloaded a story and was skeptical as to why it wasn\u2019t working and i almost commented abt but then i discovered that u need to go to the downloads folder on the app and then access it from there which i think is very unclear unless u dig around a bit, so maybe you guys can make it part of the intro when u introduce the app to the person who downloaded it so that they have an easier time?","692":"Webtoons has allowed me to find so many new and wonderful stories by authors that may not have other options for publication. However, not all of these stories are happy and\/or innocent. By censoring stories that stray from a \u201csafe\u201d story path, you discourage unique and challenging tales that give cause for thought and exploration of sexuality. The world is not always safe for work - Webtoons need not censor stories that engage the mind because they offend the easily sensitive. If websites such as Twisted Tea can allow individuals to browse their site through input of an age appropriate Birthday then so too should Webtoons. Otherwise many great safe for work stories and a lovely platform.","693":"I\u2019ve loved webtoon, from the variety of comics to the types of content the comics delt with. I was able to read of people like me (gay men\/women) and got to feel a connection to them. But like all romances this involved the act of loving. Ever since the policy updates many of the BL\/GL comics have been taken down. I get this isn\u2019t a pornographic website, but make a rule, if you are 19+ you are allowed, ask for a birthday, verify it when they make an account. I get you don\u2019t want sex, but come on, your most popular genre is romance... if some people want it a little Pg-19 then so be it. So many people are leaving it breaks my heart. And it makes me sad to think I\u2019ll have to leave webtoon and go to tapas when all of my favorite comics are gone.","694":"I love this app, I've been using it for almost a year now. But they made a VERY STRICT rule about nsfw content. I COMPLETELY understand the need to blurs out nudity, blood, gore, etc. But the new rules are so uptime that authors are  forced to remove pages that are admit to the storyline if there is gore, blood or nudity. Personally, I am huge on reading romance and thrillers on this app, but so much is blurred out that it makes it difficult to fallow the story line. The authors ALWAYS give warning at the beginning of the pages about blood ,gore and nudity and there is a 18+ policy. But these new EXTREMELY strict rules even make authors blur things even after the warning. This is why I'm giving a low rating. Otherwise I love this app and use it daily without fail.","695":"I love this! Amazing stories and super captivating but the one problem is, I will read and read and read and then to get to the next episode i had to wait 5 days. My 5 days was over today but when i finished that episode it told me to go onto the next episode I did. Only for it to tell me I had to wait another 7 days to read the next one! Can\u2019t I just watch a quick add or something instead of waiting for days just to watch one episode! Anyway, without the waiting part, I would give it 5 stars but I will stick with giving it 4 stars.","696":"Mostly when I get bored I hop right onto webtoon to read. (Just saying webtoon is the only thing I read I don\u2019t read books) well just saying it\u2019s an amazing app I love it and there is nothing bad to say about it! I forced my friends to download it and they did and now they love it!! It\u2019s a great way of people showing off there work and reading great stories of these amazing characters! \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc99\u2764\ufe0fif you don\u2019t love the app then you hit your head somewhere, because this app is AWESOME!! Thank you so much for every single comic a day and thank you for the app! \ud83d\udda4\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a\n\n~Dylin","697":"I don\u2019t usually write a review on anything but one thing I\u2019ve noticed since I\u2019ve updated is that it crashes a lot and when I click on the app it takes forever to load and then if it takes too long it crashes I don\u2019t know if this is a bug or I guess possibly it could be my phone but I just wanted to report it.\nBesides that this app is really good I love the stories on it and they\u2019re addicting and time consuming because you just get lost in stories.","698":"The comics on here are great. Some are really pushing the boundaries of what a digital comic can be and its incredible. To not be reading is to be missing out.\n\nThe performance of the app however, doesn\u2019t deserve more than 3 stars. There\u2019s nowhere to report bugs on the app, which is a problem when it has so many. Often times stories that are supposed to have music in them just break, and you loose out on immersion, or every few months it will log you out of your account along with all your subscriptions. Do they know about any of this? Who knows, because there\u2019s no place to report bugs.","699":"I used to be such an avid webtoon user and am so in love with so many of the stories and comics, the authors on the app truly are talented. Truthfully I hadn\u2019t used the app in a while and upon rejoining recently, I found that the app has a daily pass function where it gives you one pass to read one episode, and that\u2019s honestly bizarre. As someone who\u2019s used webtoon in the past this came as quite a shock to me. I genuinely enjoy this app but I\u2019m not gonna pay to reread chapters of stories I\u2019ve already read (even though I want to) because I don\u2019t have the money to do that (I\u2019m a student). Until that function is revised or removed I probably won\u2019t be using webtoon in a while yet again.","700":"Okay so I absolutely LOVE webtoon! Its just that in some webtoons, the episodes don't load and its just blank. I cant see what is the new episode and I have to click the \u201cgo to first episode\u201d button, re-read it, and then I can finally get to the new episode, for example on the webtoon made by soojunga \u201cPainted\u201d, whenever I click on it I don't see the episodes and all I see is the summary, \u201c go to first episode button\u201d, and the \u201cBecome a patron\u201d button. Please fix this as soon as you can but other than that Webtoon is awesome and keep up the good work!","701":"I loved WEBTOON due to the fact that it was one of the few apps where you didn\u2019t have wait to read. I liked being able to binge read as much as I could for free. I do realize some are free but the ones I read most are now locked and the fact that I have to spend real money to binge my favorite comics Is very annoying. I will not be spending money and I hope you go back to the original way without having to pay because I will not be keeping the app if you don\u2019t . I know that\u2019s not a huge threat but I feel like this move your making is going to make people search for another app. Seriously this was my favorite comic reader but I have no interest in spending my hard earned money to read previously free content .","702":"I love the new update keep up the good work and please don\u2019t do this I see y\u2019all done this with one of the story I already read it say I got to wait to read story again I use to buy 5 coin not wait for or use 3 coin to read a story I already read  I wanting to go back because some days I have no coin to use so I go back to read them until I get some money to read them I like to keep using 5 coin and sorry for my bad grammar but love your app and everything this been helping me get better at reading","703":"So webtoon is amazing. We al know this. And all these artists give us inspiration for our own stories. But sadly a lot of us have no time or money (or even talent) what if. What iffff. What if webtoon added a section for plotters. And artists with art block or wanting to do a story but not sure what could go and pick their favorite plots. And even if you\u2019re not a plotter you can like other people\u2019s plots to try and get them up to the top where artists can see them. It\u2019d be like a matchmaking service for artists and writers.","704":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for years now and I\u2019ve never had a problem with it until the latest update. Ever since I put to update it, it\u2019s really slow, the \u201cFor You\u201d screen is just blank, I can only see the tab bars at the bottom. When I try yo click on the \u201cMy\u201d tab, it takes so long to actually get there and when it does, the stories I\u2019m subscribed to also take a long time to appear. When I\u2019m near the end of a chapter, pop up ads appear and it takes me to safari and freezes the app. Please fix this update of just remove it and leave it how it was before the update.","705":"The content of this app is amazing! Some stories seem like they should be published. However the app itself is disappointing for the most part. The content never seems to be available when the time signature says so. For example the next chapter to a story I\u2019ve been interested in called Lore Olympus never sends me a notification when new chapters become available even when the notification bell is activated. Even then the chapters say they will be available, for example, in five days. But over a week in the available day only goes down to say it will be available in two days. This app would reach an incredible potential if these minor changes could be made.","706":"So I started reading an incredible story through snapchat and I wanted to read the rest so I downloaded that app. When I was trying to sign up it wouldn\u2019t accept my email (even though I\u2019m positive that it\u2019s correct) and I checked it many times to make sure there were no errors. Then it kept saying \u201cstrong?\u201d When I was trying to make a password. I changed it again and again but it kept saying the same thing. I really want to Finish my story so can you please help me fix my problem? Thanks!!!","707":"I always loved webtoon and is a place where they creators can post their works without problem and us readers appreciate they effort in all the art, but thanks to the new policy a lot of artist and creators had to change the work eliminated or stop it since it doesn\u2019t allow any kind of explicit scenes when is something that is part of the story when is censored is still part of the story and part of the characters wich sometimes can\u2019g be change, pls I will like for the people who manage this new policy to think about it because a lot of readers would like to have the webtoon that it was before just for that I\u2019ll give it three stars for now","708":"This is one of my favorite app and I\u2019m glad that I installed this. I really enjoy reading the WEBTOONS that were created. Spending coins for episodes until they come out is reasonable. But the daily passes isn\u2019t. I researched that when there\u2019s a daily pass, soon the completed WEBTOON will not be here anymore. And what if you spend coins on reading it? What if you spend your coins for ALL the episodes to read it? I think that feature shouldn\u2019t be here. It\u2019s also sad because the creators work hard and all their work just goes away. Please take out this feature.","709":"This app is truly just amazing. Like how it can just let creators share their gifts with this platform and the other people on it, but there is one thing I am concerned about.\nThe In-App purchasing won\u2019t work for me on my device. Whenever I try to purchase Coins again (since it didn\u2019t work the first time.), it is just stuck on a loading screen saying that I already purchased it and it will be restored for free. Well, it isn\u2019t free because it is taking up so much time, and my own time I could spend reading. You should fix your In-App purchases.","710":"WEBTOON is a fine place to find good stories, but the service itself has obvious flaws. I just simply don\u2019t get daily pass. I don\u2019t like having to wait a full day to read a chapter of completed stories until I finish. And I absolutely will never pay for more. I won\u2019t support something this idiotic. There are so many good ones like \u201cOrange Marmalade\u201d and \u201cWhere the Tangents Meet\u201d that get blocked by the paywall. Why? Why? Why? I don\u2019t get it. If there are a large bunch of great comics people want to read, the worst idea is to stop them from reading them. It\u2019s undeniably the worst idea I\u2019ve seen on this platform that I would personally go and find all 7 Dragon Balls to wish the daily pass never existed.","711":"I have been yawing this app for a couple of years and have never had a problem till now. I would try and click on a story that I saw on an add and thought oh that looks good but then I would click on it and my phone would freeze for a second then kick me out of WEBTOON like seriously I just wanna read the story. But every time I click on the story I would not let me it would kick me out now I don\u2019t know if more people have had this problem but it\u2019s seriously annoying I just wanna look at the story that\u2019s been on here for like ever now but nooo it won\u2019t let me.","712":"I really loved Webtoon until they released their new policy regarding NSFW.  Currently, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s censored or not it\u2019s not aloud and I really hate it.  I read many webtoons that include such things, and now they have to change their stories that they\u2019ve worked on to fit webtoon.  Some are even considering posting their comics somewhere else and it\u2019s completely horrible.  It\u2019d be fine if you just made them censor it but nothing at all?  It\u2019s outrageous and I believe it should be changed.  That however, is just my opinion.  But it is also the opinion of many other.","713":"Webtoon is amazing.  There\u2019s no getting around that.  The artists are great and some even get paid if there is enough views.  The only complaint which isn\u2019t really one but I would like to request you be able to publish a comic on mobile because drawing on a computer doesn\u2019t really cut it if I have to draw with a mouse just suggesting though.  This is by far the best app I have on my phone.  You should totally download it.  I haven\u2019t had any problems or issues and I\u2019ve had Webtoon since the first week it came out.","714":"I love this app. But the reason I gave it 1 star because idk if anyone else is also experiencing this, but I can\u2019t open the app and do anything without it freezing on me. I tried subscribing to a story that looked interesting, didn\u2019t work. I tried reading on a story I\u2019ve already subscribed to, didn\u2019t work. Idk what\u2019s going on. I also just for a new phone. I see other reviews saying that because of a new policy, the app is starting to go downhill now. That\u2019s so sad.\n\nUpdate: my app is up and running again. no more freezing.","715":"I love all the stories these WEBTOON creators have provided us with, however there has been a new policy put in place the limits the creators in what they are able to post. No more NSFW is allowed on this site even when it is censored. For some of the comics this will not affect the story however for the comics that have a more adult following\/mature themes and relationships this can affect the story and how the creators themselves are able to continue posting on WEBTOON. This is very discouraging and disappointing as a reader and potential author. Not sure if I will continue using WEBTOON after this...I will be following the creators to a different site if they choose to leave so they can continue their comics as they were intended to be written.","716":"I wanna give this app 5 stars because it\u2019s great! I don\u2019t have to pay for a new episode each week unless I want to fast pass. But I\u2019ve had this weird experience of reading a Webtoon and while enjoying it, a weird ad looking thing pops up where a webcam slowly looks at you as if it\u2019s spying on you. And then when you try to swipe it up to close it, it just won\u2019t die unless it finishes looking at you. And this has happened to me 3 times! I\u2019ve deleted the app.... unless someone explains to me why this is happening or investigates it, I\u2019m not redownloading the app.","717":"First, I love WEBTOON. The artists on there are amazing and I love discovering new comics all the time. \n\nMy only issue is with the free coin events. The past two I\u2019ve been unable to participate in because the pop up, indicating the event, is white, before the app crashes on me. It happens at the end of every participating episode and is a little inconvenient at the most. I don\u2019t particularly care if I\u2019m unable to participate, but it\u2019s nice to have those coins to use to support my favorite artists. I\u2019m not sure if this is an issue with just me, or the app itself but I\u2019d like them to know what\u2019s happening!","718":"Love love love this app!! However, these past few weeks the app has been lagging a CRAZY amount! Every time I open the app it takes a good few minutes to start up and then it\u2019ll be frozen for another few minutes before I can scroll through the app and actually use it. Also, whenever it finally works and allows me to click on a WEBTOON, it takes forever to load the page with all the episodes. The search function also lags a ton. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! I love this app but honestly having it lag makes me v frustrated and not want to use it \u2639\ufe0f","719":"This app is so amazing if you want to get inspiration for your own art, or just to pass time. Every creator on this app puts so much effort into the storyline and art, which I am so appreciative of. Webtoon is one of my favorite apps. I look forward to every notification that I get when a series a love gets updated. I can tell that Webtoon truly is an app where creators can get a great start to their career. Overall, if you don\u2019t already have Webtoon installed, then what are you waited for! I beg you t9 join this awesome community!","720":"The app is a good app except for the fast pass and the way that it scrolls but other than that not to bad my main concern is that whenever I went to open it today it wouldn\u2019t open and so I reset my phone and tried so I deleted the app but when I redone loaded it and when I deleted it again it said I still had the app so I restarted my phone and it was on my home screen with a blank logo and so I deleted them restarted my phone and it was back again and I can\u2019t get it to go away. Any body have anything similar happen or have any ideas?","721":"Since the latest update, this app has been glitching. It will let me open a story and a chapter, but when I go to go back to the main page in the app to view all my subscriptions, it won\u2019t let me exit the story I had just read. I have to leave the app and clear it, then reopen it just to view a new story only to have to repeat myself again and again to read all the stories I subscribe to- which is a lot. It\u2019s getting pretty tiring and I will probably stop using WEBTOON until it can get fixed, as it is just annoying each time I try to use it.","722":"Sooo, I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for a few months now and have absolutely loved it! The only thing I didn\u2019t necessarily like was the fast pass and all those annoying \u201cFAST PASS WHERE YOU AT\u201d comments. However, it didn\u2019t bother me that much. One thing I entirely HATE is this daily pass thing where you only get to read 2 episodes a day from completed webtoons. I had to wait an awfully long 2 months before getting to finish \u201cOrange Marmalade.\u201d I\u2019m just glad I got to read Bastard before it went through this daily pass stuff. Any who, that\u2019s the main thing that bothers me. Other than that, love the webtoon artists and their lovely stories!","723":"I\u2019ve used the website for about two years. About five months ago I got to download the app, and it\u2019s great! I\u2019ve found so many new and interesting stories, and still love my original favorites. The one complaint I have is to stop letting creators use so much fast pass, especially if they are just starting. The story should be suspenseful, and not being able to buy Fast Pass almost gives it a sense of excitement! But overall, this is my favorite app to use! Excited for any new updates to come!","724":"I fell in love with this app it has so many verities of comics it really helped me get into reading comics. The creaters on this app are amazing they have great stories and artistry skills. But the only downside is the new policy which prohibits any talk and showing of sexual activity and for me when comics talk about real life stuff like sex it makes the comics more believable and not just some lovey dovey stoybook\/movie comic, which gets me excited for the new updates every week. So in conclusion this app is great i just hope that webtoons will reconsider these new policies.","725":"I preferred before the latest update. Before, the webtoons under your profile would have an \u201cup\u201d icon that showed when the newest chapter had been uploaded and had these webtoons pushed to the top of your collection. now it just sorts the webtoons based on when you last opened them with no icon to see if chapters have been updated and since it doesn\u2019t get automatically pushed to the top, you have no way of knowing if it uploaded or not unless you turn on notifications (which can get annoying if youre following a bunch of different webtoons) or open every single webtoon individually to check for yourself.","726":"Everyone is doing good with this app but it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t exist for me too I love the app and I can\u2019t wait to see what I have on the app and it makes it easy for my iPhone and I can\u2019t wait to see what if you can get a better app for the internet to see what if you can get a new character to it or somethin the internet to get it and you have internet internet and you have internet connection to use it for a long thing to get it and it is just really like your friends","727":"Honestly this is one of my favorite apps...I love all of the stories and the artwork and I just think this is the coolest thing ever! However, I only downloaded it because of a friend\u2019s recommendation, and I was not planning on downloading it because I had seen the ads for it...I think that more people would install Webtoon if the ads were less IN YOUR FACE and more \u201cThousands of titles to look through\u201d because the ones that are currently up are very cringey. Please consider what I have to say and know that your app is awesome!!!","728":"I enjoy this app very much the only problem I have with this app is that I do not have the ability to save or mark a webtoon I plan pn reading in the future for me to save it I have to subscribe to the webtoon then view it on my subscribe list however that causes my subscription list to become hectic and full causing me to be unable to read newer or older comics the evidence previously presented clearly shows or states how Line: Webtoon should include a feature that allows a reader to save a comic they plan on reading in the future causing less confusion and anger.","729":"Hello! I\u2019ve used this app for almost a year now, and I\u2019ve been very, very active with it - I must\u2019ve read about six or seven completed series, and I\u2019m caught up with ten or twenty more of them. This said - it\u2019s sort of worrying when I find that it suddenly crashes every time I try to open the app. I deleted it and redownloaded it but right as the logo appears, when it would usually change to the WebToon a original page, it crashes and exits me out of the app. I\u2019m on an iPhone XR, if that helps any.","730":"I recently got webtoon after seeing an ad about the story true beauty. I hadn\u2019t even read it and I got hooked. I immediately fell in love and kept reading. My life outside got harder and harder with grades and sports but every Tuesday the one thing I can rely on is finding out what happens next. It\u2019s not just true beauty I\u2019ve started other ones and was instantly addicted. I love webtoon it gives me some more gas for the next milestone in my life. It gives me something to look up to it\u2019s by far one of the best apps out of my 40\ud83d\ude09","731":"Coins are very useful. They let you see episodes faster, but there is one HUGE PROBLEM. For example, I bought 5 coins. I bought a new episode and read it. But the episode after the one I bought is STILL 12 days away?? I think a new UPDATE should be that when you buy an episode, the one behind it moves up to how far away the one you just bought would be if you didn\u2019t buy it. I asked a lot of friends who had WEBTOON and they agreed with me. I hope this becomes and UPDATE. Thank you.","732":"Can you all make ways for people to earn free coins like other web comic\/manga apps (Web Comics, Manga Toons) do?  I know I'm not the only one who doesn't have extra money to spend on coins.  With each \"fast pass\" episode costing 5 coins, a person could spend a looot of money if they read more than one comic that has \"fast pass\"!!!\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\nI'm sure that many readers would still buy coins in addition to coins that could be earned.  Providing ways to earn free coins may convince people that you're not ripping off (mostly) kids and young adults who may otherwise spend their money on more useful things!!!!!!!","733":"So ive had this for awhile now and ive been reading stories but at the end of the story where you slide up to go to the next one i will slide up and it will glitch out and not let me go to the next story. Please fic, thank you!!! Other than that is it a 20\/5 app it has great stories and great graphics and just overall great everything. There is hpwever something that bothers me, the background of the storys, if you could change the color of the background from the settings that would be awesome. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","734":"I\u2019ve read WEBTOONS for about five years now. Yes, it has been a long time. I have to say this, the lack of diversity that\u2019s seen on Naiver is really holding this app back from greatness. I want you guys to do better so more of my friends could read these wonderful stories, but they are bombarded with nothing but romance, and it turns people away when that\u2019s all they see on their home screen. LINE WEBSTOONS used to be better, but I\u2019m starting to get tired of the same old thing. Bring great series for adults back like Annasumanara, or bring over some more adult series from Naiver and translate them to build a brand that will truly be untouchable. That way, everyone can have a large amount of material to read, and not just the people who like overdone romance.","735":"I love WEBTOON so much, and I\u2019ve been a user for years! But I think I\u2019m having a technical problem. For a couple of months now, I haven\u2019t been able to like anybody\u2019s webtoons. At first it only happened with the big webtoons that had 99,999+ hearts. Now it\u2019s happening with a lot of them. I redownloaded the app, kept the app up to date and even tried it on the computer, but it still isn\u2019t letting me heart some of the webtoons. Please fix this \ud83d\ude22 it breaks my heart to think I can\u2019t show my support to my favorite authors.","736":"I would give it a five stars, if it weren't for the few problems. I love the comics and how it's really easy to use. I want to post stories, but don't know how to on the app. When I am reading a comic, sometimes it just won't load, even if I click the refresh button. Even if I background app refresh, sometimes it doesn't load. When I try to open new comics to read, it doesn't even load. Please improve this. I love this app, it just need little improvements. Sorry if it's just my wifi, because on data and normal it doesn't load.","737":"I spend at least 7 hours a day in this app!!!! It is so amazing, there are so, so,so many good stories and great art!!!!! And wow, I just don\u2019t know what to say.... but I would say 12+ because language (say f word and a*s and some other words) and mild \u201clovemaking\u201d but otherwise perfectly fine!!! You can rate the story and once a week they update (meaning they add a chapter to the story.) On the east coast it updates at 12:00 pm and on the west coast they update at 9:00!! If u like comics this is 100% for you, and if you download it you won\u2019t regret it, trust me!!!!!!","738":"It has many types of stories for everyone. Super easy to use. It shows the most popular liked stories for people who don\u2019t know what to read next (helps me to find interesting stories that helps me makes sure they\u2019re good and interesting). It saves where you are in every story. And they don\u2019t shove ads in your face 24\/7!!!! I recommend this to kids that are 13 and up because some stories use language that all parents might not be ok with them reading. But otherwise this app is amazing.","739":"Webtoon is the best app ive ever had if you've got nothing to do you have webtoon here to excite you with so many emotions. The authors in webtoon can make you cry, scream, and make you have butterflies in your stomach.  It can help you take your mind of the world and bring you to a whole new world of imagination. Be careful tho it can be dangerous because you wont stop wasting your money on buying more episodes \ud83d\ude02. They have all the  genres for you and finding a new webtoon to read is even better! My rating is a 10\/10 FOR SURE!","740":"Ok so I\u2019m gunna try to explain this the best I can. Webtoon\u2019s stories are absolutely amazing! When they say that they have stories to OBSESSS over they mean it! Although the fast pass and waiting a week for a new episode is annoying that not why I\u2019m giving this 4 stars instead of 5. Personally I don\u2019t like the 12+ rating. I\u2019m 13 and I will admit some of these stories are a bit inappropriate for me, I had to be very careful with the romance ones on what was ok to read and not read. So to anyone under 17 -18 just be careful on what your reading but most are ok! Overall love the app \u2764\ufe0f","741":"As much as I love the app, all the stories I\u2019m reading seem like they are on hiatus. \n\nThey take longer to be able to read them then waiting for tatay91 on wattpad to update. \n\nNo offense. \n\nBut it\u2019s because you have to wait at a minimum of 2 WEEKS to be able to read them. Sometimes longer, if not, longer. \n\nSo if I\u2019m waiting for lore Olympus to update or true beauty, oop \n\nNow I have to add time to that. \n\nI know your tryna my to make money and all, but don\u2019t ya think that more than two weeks of waiting is a rip off. \n\nI mean, the app is great, and it\u2019s not your fault people actually have their story\u2019s on hiatus, like for real, but I\u2019m just mad because when those people to update, I have to wait longer to see it now. \n\nSo please, if you could bring it down, even if it\u2019s just a little bit, please. I know people want to make money and all, but having to wait that long is so frustrating. \n\nThank you for reading.","742":"Amazing app! User friendly! \nBut puh-LEAZEEE add a way to hide the comment section for readers. I cannot tell you how many times I have taken an innocent peek at the comment section at the end of a comic and have just gotten massively spoiled \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude10. I just want to hide them entirely\u2014 or atleast hide the top comments! Why would I want to continue a comic if someone has spoiled it for me??? \nI\u2019m keeping it five stars because I know it\u2019s not Webtoon\u2019s fault for other people\u2019s comments. I really hope they see this review and add that feature tho \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30","743":"What is up with daily passes?????? I used to read episodes that had already been updated by the author whenever I wanted to and just had to wait or pay for the newer episodes. This is infuriating, and the fact that I can\u2019t even go back and read chapters I\u2019ve already read? It used up a daily pass to read a chapter I had left off on when I clicked on the story as well. What is this update, it may be nothing to new readers but why do the people that have been here for a long while have to start doing this new daily pass thing, at least leave the past chapters we\u2019ve already read open so we can remind ourselves before we read on","744":"I\u2019ve updated my phone, the app, uninstalled and reinstalled it, and restarted my phone three times. It will not load. I was in the middle of a comic and it crashed on me and I haven\u2019t been able to get it up since. Now I like the app, I\u2019m ok with spending some money on coins here and there, and I think the stories are nice. But there is no point in any of that if I can\u2019t even open it back up to get into my account. I\u2019ve cleared caches, I have space on my phone, it just won\u2019t load. I have so many stories I\u2019ve been following and now I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to read any of them. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll get my coins back.","745":"I love WEBTOON but a few months ago the app started  buffering. I would be able to use that app then all of a sudden it would say that it can\u2019t connect to the wi-Fi even though I had it on. I would then turn my wi-Fi off and on but it still wouldn\u2019t work. I had to delete and reinstall the app for it to work. But I don\u2019t want to have to do this every time it done want to work, and recently it won\u2019t play the videos so that I can read the story\u2019s \nThank you! \nPlease fix it.","746":"So I have been on the Webtoon app for well over a year now, and it is one of my favorite apps out there. I\u2019ve never had issues with it until now. A few weeks ago it started getting laggy, at first it would just take its time loading but then some comics wouldnt load at all, and when sliding the screen would freeze halfway. I tried to push through bc I truly love the app but tonight the comics wouldnt even load, and I was unable to click on chapters. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if that would fix it, but now it wont even let me log back in. It says error and then it won't  let me click out of it PLEASE HELP, I\u2019d rate five stars once the problem is fixed, I\u2019m just completely unable to access the app now.","747":"There are some bots replying to each comment with links, I suppose you deal with that. Oh, and the Daily Pass thing? Ridiculous. I\u2019m so close to leaving this app, because it keeps adding more things for money. Webtoon doesn\u2019t seem to understand that it\u2019s appeal in the first place was being the one webcomic app that was truly free. What\u2019s the difference between Daily Pass and the Luff system at Lezhin? Soon they\u2019ll pull a Wattpad and you can only read two of your downloaded Webtoon\u2019s for free, and if you want to read the rest, you need \u201cPremium.\u201d As soon as Webtoon has a \u201cPremium\u201d option, you best believe I\u2019m leaving for Lezhin. Less cash-for-grabby for a wider selection of comics.","748":"I was not a big reader at all, but after I got WebToon I was the biggest reader lol! I love how the ads are shown at the bottom of an episode and not in your face while you are trying to read. I also love that they translate books! I can\u2019t name all the stuff I love about this app but if you have the time to get hooked on a couple comics then I strongly recommend WebToon! But however, I see that you have recently added the coin system. The main thing that I loved about this app is that it was completely free, I don\u2019t like that I have to pay to read newer episodes.","749":"I love this app so so so so much, and always will but it\u2019s been getting very picky wit mature content and now one of my favorite authors is going to have to quit writing, the story being one of any I read that the author is going have leave is probably going to be the reason I will delete this app. The last time this author posted it was them saying this is go going to one of the last, they did even get to the main story line, I think it is unfair not only to the creators who most have made this to get their work out and is use this as a platform to start a business but to the readers who enjoy and support the creators.","750":"I love this app. I read comics on it almost everyday. I think it's such a cool way to find new, creative content. I feel really connected to the creators. It is so fun to react to a new chapter with a whole bunch of other people who all just felt the same things you did. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to rate it not quite perfect because I do have one qualm. I wish there were more ways to sort the subscription box. It can be really annoying to find something you're looking for if you haven't read it in awhile, especially if it's no longer updating regularly.","751":"The new policy has effected many of my favorite authors and creators, leaving their stories untold or putting them on other websites. I was sad to know that my favorite webtoon comic, \u201cSweet Boy\u201d by Theyaoiarmy stopped posting due to this policy and I was very sad to hear that along with the other 27 webtoons that I loved that had to stop during the middle of the story.\n\n   Maybe if webtoons changed the age requirement for the app to 13+ instead of 9+, it would be better for the readers and the authors. And (obviously) take away the policy of explicit content and nudity and put it back to normal.\n\n  All in all, I love webtoons and hope it will get better, just get rid of the policy please :)","752":"So I really LOVE WEBTOON its amazing and it has so many great stories! It also makes me have mixed emotions when Im reading a story and Im so deep into it. The only thing I absolutely hate the daily passs thing. i really dont want to wait fo 7, 14 daya until the next episode it honestly just frustrates me! For example if Im going really deep into a story and then I want to know what happens next so bad I clicl the next episode and I see that I have to waot or pay coins. 75 percent of the people using this dont have the money to pay or find it complicated to do things like this on a device. Overwall, amazing app!!","753":"Nope. I do not deal with pop up ads for apps. I don't mind banner ads, or side ads, or options to click to watch an ad, or pay to get rid of ads but as soon as they force videos to pop up at the beginning and end of every chapter it gets beyond annoying. I'm giving it a little time to see if things change.\n\nEdit: woo!! Maybe I've just been lucky or they really have changed things but I haven't had a pop up ad awhile! So back to a 5 star review as long as this lasts!","754":"Ever since reading the reviews of the app WEBTOON after downloading it I believe EVERY SINGLE WRITER OR READER can agree that the new policy must go. For those who gave those reports would\u2019ve been fairly warned with the usual reminder of \u201cThis is 18+ content. Do you wish to continue reading?\u201d and all you guys do is add this new policy of forcing creative and wonderful authors to delete their hard work they spent days maybe even months on, and for what! Just to satisfy those who don\u2019t pay attention to the warning while the rest us are angry and disappointed. Not cool WEBTOON, not cool.\n-Your fellow reader","755":"I have used the same account to read the comics for as long as I can remember. However, one day WEBTOON logged me off and when I tried to sign in, it would not let me. I reset the password and logged in with the new password but failed. I created a new gmail and with that gmail, made a new account and then logged in but also failed. I had many free coins and credits with my old gmail, but I was kind enough to discard the fact that I was no longer able to log into WEBTOON with that old gmail and spend my coins. However, I won\u2019t let it fly that I am not even able to log into WEBTOON anymore. I already wasted time creating a new gmail just so I can create another account to log in. HORRIBLE!!!!","756":"I love the app, but I believe there was a glitch of some kind. I started the Royal Romance collection to gain five free coins. I read all the episodes of the \u201cRemarried Empress\u201d and \u201cYour Throne\u201d yet it didn\u2019t give me the reward of reading them. Participating in this has really invested me in the two Webtoons stories. I loved the empowerment and betrayals in both but, I believe it should give me the coins it promised. If it was going to glitch and not give me the coins I would have taken my time to read through these Webtoons slower to better fit my schedule. I read my booty off for these coins and didn\u2019t get them!! Please Webtoon app developers can you help me out to figure out why this glitched and didn\u2019t give me my coins?","757":"I\u2019ve had this app for almost 4 years, and it\u2019s been absolutely great! Everything\u2019s been going smooth, up until about a month ago though. There were just a few WEBTOONS where if I pressed it, it would freeze up and nothing would work. If I didn\u2019t double tap the home screen and swipe up after a minute or so, then a few minutes later it would just exit the app on its own. The WEBTOONS it freezes up on are some of the oldest WEBTOONS I\u2019ve been reading, and I miss it. \nPlease fix it?","758":"I enjoy WEBTOON so much! It\u2019s exciting to discover and read new comics everyday. Every comic is always different from the next one you read. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to not want to fast pass stories...but they are so goooood. My favorite part of the entire app is the comment section for each story. I love to read what other fans are thinking and connecting over the same trauma of watching our characters suffer together. THE COMMENTS ARE ALWAYS THE BEST! I definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves to setback and get caught up in a story.","759":"Webtoon is the only one of these comic apps to do everything right. They use minimal ads that only require you to scroll through them. They have done everything right with their newish coin system. You have the option to stay a free user without losing anything. The comics update regularly with or with out coins. I wish every artist used webtoon. Definitely recommend this app to anyone who is tired of pay to read systems and just wants to enjoy the work of a good artist.","760":"It\u2019s a great app for comics but it needs updates for usability. It is really hard to search to find comics from canvas. For example you can\u2019t search a genre like vampires or Greek mythology to find things you are interested. Also the fast pass system isn\u2019t great. Currently if you use fast passes eventually you just end up waiting for another week to use fast pass again. So it\u2019s kind of pointless unless there is a season finale coming up. The recommendations aren\u2019t great yet either because It\u2019s not very personalized.","761":"I love webtoon\u2019s don\u2019t get me wrong, it gets me through my break and many creators have brought a smile to my face. However due to the new policy many creators are taking down old pages and putting new ones some even going as far as starting the story all over from the beginning. Many creators censored their content before this policy and I can\u2019t see why Nsfw was such a big problem if they were doing this and they even put up the age restriction through the app and even before Nsfw scenes. Webtoon really needs to fix this cause this doesn\u2019t feel like the same Webtoon that brought me many great creators and was accepting of everyone. Please change this policy Webtoon.","762":"As we all know, WEBTOON has a new policy to make sure content is safe for kids on the discover section so no mature content there. I loved discover and it was very fun to look in the section and, see randomness. As in Comedy, Slice of Life, Thriller, Horror, etc. but my most favorite, Romance. Trust me, I loved WEBTOON before this policy happened. But now that this policy has come into place, creators are leaving the site, and now I have unsubscribed to almost all my favorite creators because they have been hit with this new rule. Now creators have nowhere to go but Tapas. Now I will have to go to Tapas just for some of my favorite creators, which means that I will spend more time in Tapas than in the WEBTOON app. \n\nThank you have a pleasant day.\n                                          -Me and most people","763":"I love cartoons and since I found this app I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without it. I like how it doesn\u2019t make you pay for anything unlike some others where you need to pay for some episodes. I also like it helps me pass time. I can spend my time either catching up or finding a new series. It\u2019s helped me start conversations with people I don\u2019t usually talk to. I\u2019m very thankful to this app and its creators. Also HUGE thanks to the artists that take time out of their lives to draw these for our entertainment.","764":"Lately my app has been crashing literally every time I reach the end of the episode. I\u2019ve deleted and redownloaded the app, but it still won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s incredibly annoying.\n\nOther than that, I love the app! I love all the different kinda of stories you can find and how they usually update consistently. The only other issues I\u2019d maybe have is the daily pass. It\u2019s impossible to read any completed series all the way through, you get one or two episodes a day...","765":"The app is really nice to use and I love reading all the comics, especially finding new comics to bing read. The only minor thing I can see improvement on is the book marking. I made an account so I can subscribe to several different comics. Since I have an account, I just wish that the book mark would be able to track where I left off regardless of where I am reading it (i.e. my phone on the app or online on my pc). Like how Netflix tracks which episode you are on regardless of which device you watch it on.","766":"I\u2019ve been using this app for years now, and I have always loved it. I read the new updates every single day. However, the daily pass feature is absolutely terrible. I like fast passes, and they didn\u2019t change anything about the reading experience since its always been an upload per week(in most cases). But the daily passes will just cause readers to use other platforms, which is worse for creators in the end. I love reading completed webtoons and bingeing them, and I would even be fine with watching and add every few episodes, but only being able to read one episode a day is ridiculous.","767":"I have used this app for awhile now and I LOVE IT! I mean the stories are great, the art work is awesome, and the community is just all around AMAZING! The way the app is designed itself is awesome too! Now with this, I only have one complaint. When I sign in on a different device other than my main device, my bookmarks aren\u2019t saved. Even with the daily pass stories. It\u2019s a real bummer, but if it gets fixed, then this app would fs be my all round favorite. (I mean it already is but it would be better!). But, I would definitely recommend downloading:)!","768":"Y'all, I don't have tv. I don't have anything to look forward to weekly (as far as programs) other than this! There are so many good stories, incredible authors sharing their work & many artists as well! I get a lot of excitement & joy knowing I can look forward to some of my favorite comics. Honestly I'm forever grateful for this app! It has the option of course to skip ahead a few \"episodes\" or \"chapters\" at a time, but it isn't necessary at all. I highly recommend this app! \ud83d\ude0a","769":"I love this app, but starting from a day or two ago, when I got to the end of a chapter, it would automatically reroute me to an ad website without me even clicking on it.  I\u2019ll close the ad window, then go back to the WEBTOON app, and the same thing would happen over, and over, and over again.  I have to kill the application, go to the next episode, and once I get to the end, I go through the same thing over again.  It\u2019s quite annoying and frustrating.","770":"Okay, I love this app! I\u2019ve had it for at least a year and a half, and it\u2019s never let me down. Two top comments, fifty subscriptions, it\u2019s great. One thing though. The coin shop, it\u2019s a cool new feature for the app. You can buy 10 coins for $.99 or 50 for $4.99. The only reason I mention this is that the cheaper coin pack is a better deal. If I were WEBTOON, I\u2019d try to make the larger packs better deals so people will spend more money. It might be 4 cents difference, but it adds up. It\u2019s just a suggestion.","771":"I\u2019ve had this app for a long time I honestly have no problems with it it\u2019s just an amazing app you will not regret getting this app at all it is awesome amazing art and storyline for each story a lot of different genres like fantasy,drama,romance,mystery,slice of life, superhero,horror,thrillers and so much more I would like to recommend some stories such as lumaine,unordinary,true beauty,mage and demon queen!these are amazong stories there are so much more awesome stories on the app well,what are you waiting for?? Go download the app and see for yourself!!","772":"The new policy that WEBTOON has created makes some of the creators change their whole story. The stories that I have read that have NSFW have warnings at the beginning, and if the readers don\u2019t want to see or read that stuff they can go past that certain part or that episode. The readers that don\u2019t mind that should still be able to read it without going to a different app or paying to read it. WEBTOON I think will start having less viewers and the ratings will go down because of this certain policy. Please take into consideration the creators that spend so much time making these stories for their readers.","773":"I absolutely loved WEBTOON (5 Star kind of love) and even got some friends to join, but the recent changes are completely ruining the viewing experience. The new policy webtoon just released for discovery has caused many artists to change if not discontinue my beloved comics. I am extremely frustrated by this. It\u2019s like reading a book with pages ripped out or reading along and discovering the entire ending was never written. The parts getting banned are the pieces we have waited 100 episodes for. They are the reason everyone keeps coming back hungry week after week. I am extremely disappointed in the changes as are thousands of avid readers. These changes completely destroyed many beautiful, funny, sensual, brilliant comics.","774":"I was really disappointed because when I first got the app I didn\u2019t have an account so I was just reading the comic but then afterwards I decided that I would get myself an account so that I can read more after about a month of having it eventually on logged me in so then I had to re-log myself back in and it did it again but I can\u2019t remember my password if there\u2019s a way you can fix this please do because I need to log myself back in and I can\u2019t figure out my password if you\u2019re reading this thank you.","775":"Look all I wanted to do was send a customer service email notification that your pop-up adds are terrible, and \u201cdo not show me again\u201d might as well not even exist. I\u2019m never going to participate in coin gathering events. I just. Don\u2019t. Care. I just want an option to opt out, or a \u201cdon\u2019t show me\u201d button that ACTUALLY WORKS. I\u2019m sick of having to constantly restart my app because these mind numbingly irrelevant pop-ups keep assaulting my phone and cussing it to freeze over things I\u2019m just not interested in. Fix it and I\u2019ll put it back at a 5 star rating. And make a customer service contact available in the future. Please and thank you.","776":"WEBTOON was my favorite app to read on but then I saw a daily pass, I couldn\u2019t sign or login and coins you have to use money I like to read stories without paying for coins to go further . That\u2019s why I normally don\u2019t use this app due to daily pass even if your addicted to the story you were reading daily pass just ruins mostly everything about reading your favorite comic. I really want daily pass to be removed so you can go further into your comic in stead of login your pawing to coins so you can unlock the chapter.","777":"I love the idea of this app because comics can be very expensive and here you can easily get access to all kinds of comics with different art styles and genres for free. However, the searching tool is a little but inconvenient. I wish that you could search for words in the description of the book instead of just the title. Also, it would be nice if there was a section when you click on a comic that lists comics like that one. I\u2019m not really a fan of the fast pass to get the next episodes but I understand it.","778":"I would say that this app is the best app out of all the other comic apps because they offer so many great stories with different varieties and styles that update every week. You will definitely find at least one story you love on this app, I strongly recommend! The only reason why it\u2019s not a 5 star is because of daily pass. The only reason why I like to read finished stories is because I don\u2019t have to wait every week, but daily pass limits the amount you get to read unless you spend coins...J really don\u2019t like this system.","779":"I have this app a five star rating because I love it and it\u2019s a great platform, especially during quarantine, however this morning when I went to open up the app it just kept going back to the home screen. So naturally I looked for an update and thought that would fix it, but it didn\u2019t, then as a last resort I turned off my phone and the app went further than earlier but then exited again. I\u2019m not sure if this is going to be fixed but I hope so.","780":"I love this app, it gives me a lot of inspiration and motivation to do art of my own. And I really enjoy being able to see what amazing stories people can make! But I have had a story I\u2019ve been wanting to make using Webtoon for a while, and I think some other people may relate to this. I don\u2019t have a computer of my own currently, and I\u2019m in a tough situation so the Line Webtoon site is restricted for me. So, I think it\u2019d be really cool if people could use the app to make their own stories. But that\u2019s kinda just an idea. The app is still good overall!","781":"So I left WEBTOONs for a little while ok maybe a long time, only a few months because I was addicted and was failing school haha anyways I come back and there are sooo many updates which is a good thing I guess but it\u2019s taking all my time and data. Secondly there are many complaints about something called pass and daily pass I don\u2019t know what that is but I\u2019m not to excited to find out. Wish me luck!! Anyways I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with this first of all I have to complete the updated before I can even go into the app and inspect.","782":"I was looking on the app, and I come across \u201cCastle Swimmer.\u201d I heard a YouTuber talk about it, so I decided \u201cWhy not?\u201d So, I start looking at the comic, but there\u2019s this little glitch that keeps happening.. every time I get to a certain part, it freezes and glitches me out of the app. I tried it again and again but it just kept happening. I know there\u2019s nothing wrong with my device, and the app doesn\u2019t need updating.. it just sort of.. happens. I\u2019m not sure what to do, so I\u2019m going to leave the app alone for a bit until I can hopefully figure out what\u2019s going on cause I wAnNa WaTcH cAsTlE sWiMmEr- but yeah. Thank\u2019s for listening!","783":"The comments and music need a little work, but this app is smooth, user friendly, and a blessing of free content that a lot of people put a lot of work into.  If you\u2019re worried about the quality of the content, WEBTOONS has you covered better than the usual user generated content site.  They put the best content for you to view first through a system of popularity as well as personalized recommendations.  The ads do not distract from the stories, and will not make you want to throw the app along with your phone into the Niagara Falls.","784":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for about 3-4 years now. Overall, it\u2019s amazing app. I definitely recommend getting this app. The webtoons on here are deep, interesting and exciting. The one problem I have is with webtoon spoiling. Not the people who create the webtoons, but webtoon itself. I\u2019m not sure what the sliding thing at top is called when you open the app, but it spoiled Lore Olympus for me. In my opinion, I think they should change the slides at the top to pictures that aren\u2019t very important moments to the story.","785":"I absolutely love this app, the amount of comics that I have seen develop and strive are astounding, although I do have one small problem... Recently something changed and now when I am reading and I go back, it puts me on the Recent tab and not back to the Subscribed tab that I was on... This is incredibly frustrating as I have a ton of comics that do small updates, so have to go back to the tab I was already at, just wastes a few seconds of time. I understand there was probably a reason for this feature but I highly dislike it, is there a way to disable\/change it?","786":"This isn\u2019t an issue with the content. More so I purchased coins, the most expensive bundle, and they never were added to my account. I have two receipts of money being taken by the App, and it has been over two weeks and the best they can do is say they are \u2018investigating\u2019. So beware, it seems to have worked for most people, but they aren\u2019t even refunding my money, which I have asked for. The customer service does not seem to even be trying to work with me, just pushing me aside for more important issues and it\u2019s really upsetting.\nUpdate:\nSTILL haven\u2019t received coins, it\u2019s been over three weeks, and after still asking for a refund they are ignoring it and just keep saying they are \u2018investigating\u2019","787":"By far WEBTOON has been awesome for me I have been on it for 1 year and. A half when I still had my old account but I got a new phone and I can\u2019t get into my old one so I was like \u2018it\u2019s ok I can just create a new account\u2019\n the problem then occurred when I I tried the strong password I used for my old account them changed it up but it still didn\u2019t work!!!\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\n  It still had the stupid \u2018Strong?\u2019 Thing! I found it super annoying when it\u2019s there I can\u2019t create a account. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25 so I can\u2019t like or add any of my fav Web Stories!!! I think maybe you can fix it a bit\n\n   Besides that the app is awesome ,no glitches , bugs or anything just that one problem! Please try fix my problem with the password thing ,Please a thank you and please respond if you can try to fix it.\n\n   Keep up the good work \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n     From: The_AnimeGeek","788":"I love this app, I love reading and finding new and different subjects to read but when I get into a story I can\u2019t stop. The having to pay for and with coins really puts me off from using this app because it frustrates me not being able to read a story that\u2019s published and is suppose to be free. I wait for the story to free and when the time is up it just tells me it will be free soon which is really annoying because I have no idea when that will be. I wouldn\u2019t mind there being coins as much if there were alternatives to having to pay for coins like for example: playing games, watching ads and etc. I don\u2019t have a lot of money and I didn\u2019t start using this app thinking I\u2019d have to spend money on it.","789":"I love this app, which is why I\u2019m giving it 5 stars. I\u2019ve got so many comics that I keep up with, and each one is amazing and unique and the stories really capture your attention. However, here lately, it\u2019s been freezing up a lot, the app will close by itself, and I have to bring it up a few times before it finally starts working. I had to delete the app and reinstall, because it just would not work for me. It\u2019s a minor issue, but I hope it\u2019s resolved soon!","790":"So I\u2019ve been reading some webtoons lately and the new rules are really hurting the authors and losing people\u2019s interest in their webtoons. I would totally rate the app five stars before the new policy but now a lot of my favorite webtoons are being cancelled or the authors have to entirely change their stories, so I would totally appreciate if you could fix this. I\u2019m just saying an idea but maybe you could make another app for mature content so you won\u2019t lose people\u2019s interest in the app and stories, the people can still enjoy their webtoons they\u2019ve been reading, and the authors can continue their work, and it won\u2019t hurt the authors either \n\n                          -thank you","791":"I love this app its great and so much to explore filled with these amazing artist!! But theres 2 things that I have noticed the past week. I didn't enjoy have to wait a couple days, weeks, or months to read one new episode. Another thing is, I'm nor sure if any of you have had this problem but when i tried to purchase coins again it would say you can only purchase something one at a time which kinda annoyed me. I hope they approve this app a little more and take my opinion :)thank you for reading to the end.","792":"Webtoon has an excellent assortment of comics from multiple genres featuring many extremely talented artists. Moreover, it\u2019s all free and you\u2019ll never be bothered by ads (I think they sometimes put one at the bottom of a chapter). One of my favorites is Tower of God, by SIU.\n\nWebtoon also has an active community of the readers that comment on each chapter of a comic. It\u2019s not the best system, but the community is usually a positive one. Not always though. \n\nOne of most disappointing things in this app is when antisemitic or racist comments are the most upvoted ones. That\u2019s on us, and not on the creators of Webtoon nor the authors. We could really do better than that.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s a great community to belong to because of the ongoing interest in comics as the stories develop over months and years. I recommend it to my friends all the time. Wish they would join me ;~;","793":"I had this app for over 2 years, and I supported so many artists but then, I accidentally deleted the app and I thought \u201c no big deal i will just download it again.\u201d So i did that and it asked me to login again. I put in my password and my email, but it said that my password was incorrect, I tried it again, and it said the same thing. Then i entered another password since i have 2 that i use a-lot, but sill the same thing. So I clicked the forgot password button and entered my email, and.... IT DIDNT SEND ME ANYTHING. So i now have no way to fond my favorite Webtoon. Nor can I support the artist. Conclusion: its a good app if you can frickin login for the sake of it.","794":"Ok so,I am only ten but I am into this stuff ( I am a Christian I promise not that it is a sin but) and I love it so much! I still gotta figure out what my email address is and what a email address is itself so I can\u2019t sign in (I use my sister olds phone may she Rest In Peace) and I LOOOOVE the Back to Earth story it\u2019s the only one I tried but I love it. I love to read and I love doing my phone to remember my sister by who died in a coma so yea great app nothing wrong with it and NO ADDS!so far but I will take it!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0ffrom: HappyMeowCat\ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udc08\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","795":"Be careful. App will easily eat your money and you will be out of luck. :( I spend a lot of money on this app because I love several of the stories on there and like to fast pass regularly. They recently deleted all my guest account info and forced me to make one without reimbursing me for my coins. Make sure you create an account before you do that otherwise they just randomly delete your info and the 5 bucks you spent on fast pass. Probably  going to delete the app and not use it for awhile because they did that to me. I hate stuff like that so much. What a scam.","796":"I would\u2019ve gave WEBTOON 5 stars, but now. No way. I love WEBTOON I\u2019ve been reading it for 4 years now. I understand they have to make money, but having the coins is enough. That is ridiculous that I\u2019ve already read the series and if I want to re-read it, I HAVE TO WAIT OR PAY?! That\u2019s not fair at all. The completed series are fantastic and sad that they had to end, but don\u2019t make us pay if we\u2019ve already read them or want to when we are already spending money on the new ones. I use to absolutely love this app more that any other comic app, but now they are just like the rest and are going to lose readers. They know this, but decide to do it anyways. I hope y\u2019all are okay with the fact it\u2019s going down hill.","797":"WEBTOON is awesome, I love it and have been using the app for years now. Just recently I decided to buy some coins for the first time due to me being impatient for a new episode to come out for a comic I enjoy. I bought the 50 coins for USD 4.99. Basically 5 dollars right? I purchase the coins and check my balance right after and I find that WEBTOON actually charged me $6. If your price is going to say $4.99 why didn\u2019t it just charge me that? Call me stingy, I don\u2019t care if it was a dollar more, I don\u2019t like the fact that the price was not exact. What am I paying extra for exactly because I was not aware of this.","798":"I\u2019ve been reading WEBTOON comics for a while, and I absolutely love them! I usually read I\u2019m The Grim Reaper, and Sunny Side Skies, which are such good comics! The thing is, one of my comics kind of glitched. I clicked on it, and it said \u201cunable to load page\u201d I waited and kept clicking on it and it said the same thing. Now I cannot read that comic because it wont let me load it. Other than that, the app is a really good comic, and I\u2019ll give it a 5 because there is always a new chapter, and I\u2019m never bored reading the comics.","799":"I have been on this app for years and I never really had a problem with slowness, everything was rather fast and well functioning. I updated the app and suddenly the app took around a minute to load, around 2.5 minutes to change categories, and around a minute for a story\u2019s episodes to appear. It is extremely annoying, the app still works but it is an inconvenience. I have also been getting ads for dildos, and sex toys. I honestly don\u2019t know why that would be targeted towards me. I don\u2019t really care about the ads, but it may be popping up on a kid\u2019s phone, and that makes me extremely uncomfortable and worried.","800":"I love WEBTOON! It has so many of my Favorite artists, and interesting stories I most likely wouldn\u2019t have found elsewhere. I just HATE that whenever you change devices, you don\u2019t know what episodes you\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s really annoying and unnecessary. I\u2019ve changed phones 4 times while using WEBTOON, and honestly, it makes me not want to download the app again since I know I wouldn\u2019t know what episodes I last read. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone, please fix this, I\u2019m tired of having to hunt for which episodes I did and didn\u2019t see.","801":"So i absolutely live WEBTOON been using since maybe a year, who knows. But recently I\u2019ve been experiencing a bug,  usually it happens when I\u2019m about to read my last weekly webtoon. WEBTOON completely disconnects from my WiFi though my phone stills has WiFi connected to it. Even if I disconnect and reconnect to my WiFi it still stays like that, even turning my phone completely off it stays like that. That is all of my inconveniences. I hope it gets fixed soon. Still love WEBTOON though. <3","802":"I\u2019ve not had many issues with this app but recently I keep getting a notice that my internet is not working (that is not the case as all of my other apps work perfectly fine) I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a server issue but I wanted to bring it to your attention just in case you were not aware of it. \n\nIt\u2019s been like this out of the blue for about three days now and no matter how many times I reset my internet connection it still doesn\u2019t want to work T-T","803":"I like the idea of coins but the thing is that it\u2019s not really fair to have to charge an audience to read the stories you have to offer yes it does make sense but there should also be a way that the readers can earn coins to continue the stories. Not everyone has money or their parents cards nor do I believe their parents would allow it. \n\nI\u2019d like to be able to use the app while listening to music it\u2019s super annoying every time I try to use it and my music keeps pausing and I keep trying to play it it continues to pause it.","804":"Soo I have had this game for a few years now and I used to read a comic every day but ever since they got this coin thingy where u have to either pay coins or sit and wait 3 days or more to read another one I haven\u2019t been able or wanted to play anymore because it\u2019s honestly very irritating especially when I really want to know what happens next. And if you are gonna keep the coin thingy at least add like $100 or more coins for like $10 or something because I\u2019m not gonna spend basically $8.00 for 80 coins \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude11","805":"Really love this app, 100% recommend it, but this comment is about a bug I\u2019m facing. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my phone or if it\u2019s the app, but every time I open it it says I have no connection. I\u2019m still able to read all comics and it shows the updates, but when I click on it all my hearts and subscription goes away. Like, I\u2019m not subscribed anymore even tho I just read it?? And all my liked chapter are disliked. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Did this happen to anyone else? What should I do?","806":"Ok, so first off, amazing app, love it so much, flawless layout, lovely display, don\u2019t ENTIRELY agree on the whole fast pass thing, by you need to make money somehow, so whatever. The one thing keeping me from giving a five star review is the freezing. I\u2019ll get through somewhere between 3-4 pages (depending on how long they are) before the entire thing freezes. The app will just stop responding, and I\u2019ll have to close out the thing entirely, plus, there\u2019s no guarantee my progress will be saved, and I might have to go through a 30+ panel page all over again.","807":"I love this app it\u2019s really fantastic to see and enjoy all these comics, people have taken a lot of time processing and making them. But however I can\u2019t ever get to look all the episodes I want, because I have to wait several days to see it because I don\u2019t any coins and I\u2019m not going buy them just for a skip pass to see the next episode. I think it would be great if they take out the coins and dates so people are able to enjoy reading there favorite comic book.","808":"The app is great, it\u2019s a nice, free place to read webcomics to your hearts content and I love it, BUT there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s always bothered me. When you leave a comic on a Webtoon, unless you get top comment, but that rarely happens. My point is, maybe find a way to find and edit your comment without having to scroll through thousands of them. Maybe have it constantly right under the top comments no matter how many likes, or constantly keep it at the top of newest comments no matter how long ago you posted it. Just a suggestion.","809":"I absolutely love this app and i use it on a daily basis, this app is free to its users and lets you access amazing stories written by dedicated authors from all over the world. The only flaw is that they hold a limit of 100 subscriptions to keep updated on the latest chapter releases, with authors having different updating schedules you can very quickly fill up the 100 slots. It\u2019s very inconvenient, time consuming, and annoying to be going back and unsubscribing from past stories, which ultimately lower the authors ratings. Please change this! Thank you","810":"I've had this app over a year now, and it's been great. The only problem is the new policy, which is: you can't put in any mature content. I feel really bad for the creators and artist who have don't this and now they have to delete some of their artwork just because of this new policy. Who cares if it has mature content in it or not, before you read the story it always warns you if they have any. I'm one of the many people who agree with this. So, I'm just asking if you could take this new policy down, not just for me but for everyone.","811":"I absolutely LOVE Webtoon don\u2019t get me wrong. But they\u2019ve added a new policy for NSFW comics, and that is you aren\u2019t allowed to post any scenes like that. Even if they are censored. It\u2019s caused a lot of amazing webtoons to go down. And the artists behind the comics aren\u2019t allowed to post what they were originally going to. Scenes that they worked hard on, and in my opinion that is not fair to the artists cause they can\u2019t post their hard work. I know that NSFW comics can be inappropriate but Webtoon could just have something that makes sure you\u2019re old enough to read it and if underage people read it, it\u2019s their fault. Not the artists.","812":"Webtoon is a great app I absolutely love it and so do a lot of other people but their are over a thousand people who think the new policy is horrible the instead of getting rid of the comics that have inappropriate stuff in them you could come up with a way to separate age groups people are getting their comics taken down because of this policy and a lot of people hate it and I don\u2019t think that this policy is fair to the authors of these comics who have worked very hard on their comics people are hating webtoon now because of the policy and I don\u2019t think this policy should be the reason for webtoon to get bad rating but it is please change it almost everyone hates the new policy.","813":"Usually most comic reading apps lock you behind a pay wall or smothers you with ads. Not only is this app and has like 2 ads which are not even noticeable. It has a way to support your favorite artists. My favorite feature is that I get to download the webtoons I\u2019m reading automatically to my phone. My one con would be there isn\u2019t a spoiler feature for story like webtoons. Seeing people discuss future spoilers without no way to be hidden is kinda a bummer. But other than that I love this app.","814":"This is an absolutely extraordinary app. It\u2019s free and the content is great. The artist care about their fans and there\u2019s always new stuff. The community for the most part is friendly and updates are frequent. They offer several languages too. I\u2019ve been using this app for over a year of consistent reading and still have not caught up with all my favorite series there\u2019s always something to read. Not to mention the interface and layout of the app are easy to learn!","815":"I recently downloaded the app before the update and it was working great  but with the new update for some reason it keeps kicking me out and making sign back in and sometimes the advertisements don\u2019t load properly so I have to leave the episode click back on it for the advertisement to play or get out of the app in general. But this is still a good app and I still love it because it has a variety of anime\u2019s to watch from and I really appreciate what you guys do.","816":"This app just became trash.\n\nEdit: Also now they have pop up ads everywhere, including when you first start the app. Many times these are for series but the close buttons for the ads are totally unresponsive.\n\nAdd in the daily pass and all the other nonsense like constant banner adds everywhere, and I more or less just stopped using this app entirely. I keep up with maybe one or two series and refuse to give them any money at all. I\u2019m guessing there are people in there that are actually crazy enough to buy into this business model, so I guess they aren\u2019t going to revert. Blind consumerism paired with infinite greed ruins all good things. Goodbye, WEBTOON. It was nice knowing you. I used to be a fan.","817":"Daily Pass is so greedy. I understand these creators work hard and deserve to be compensated, but to manipulate people into spending money via this new daily pass feature is really disappointing to those of us who adore this app and would like to properly support these creators without being scammed. \nWhy not also include an option to buy the completed series that we could own permanently and go back and read as often as we\u2019d like? \nI\u2019ll bump my rating back up to 5 stars when you decide to be reasonable and not like every other money hungry app on the market right now.","818":"I have to start off with how much I love this app I recently got it I had it two years ago but I got a new phone and got it again I really love the stories I spent most of my day on this app in fact it my most used app I think it\u2019s good sure I do have to wait for a new episode every week but I do understand that the creators need their money I mean I think the money goes to them but I still love this app no matter what thank you for this app I shared it to my friends and they love it too!\ud83e\udd2a\u26a1\ufe0f","819":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for years now and I love it so much! I spend a lot of my time on it but now (the past two days) it hasn\u2019t been loading properly. You see, i didn\u2019t have a problem with the app before and it was running smoothly until Thursday\u2019s update arrived. I was reading some webtoons and then moved onto another one and it would just take me to a white screen where the app froze. I tried deleting it, it didn\u2019t work, I tried using data, NOPE, I tried logging out of the app and back in, and there was no difference. WEBTOON please fix this I really don\u2019t want it stop reading...","820":"Honestly I\u2019ve been in love with WEBTOON for a long time time and one thing I\u2019ve been noticing since I\u2019ve been downloading more comics is that it\u2019s harder to keep track on comics I haven\u2019t finished. It would be an amazing feature if you could put a filter on it where you can see what webtoons have new updates that you forgot about. It\u2019s a pet peeve of mine to keep clicking every WEBTOON and continuing to go all the way up the list of comics again. Also we need tapping again! Scrolling can be a bother... but besides that, Thank you for the app and great service!","821":"Really enjoy the app, but they don\u2019t have the best customer care team. \nParticipated in a \u201cread 100 pages of canvas\u201d challenge for 5 coins. Wasn\u2019t even really doing it for the coins. Reading 100 pages is something I\u2019d do anyways. Was told I completed the challenge and won my coins. Hit redeem, but never received them. \nContacted customer care and they took weeks to get back to me, only to say \u201cyou had to hit redeem to get your coins and the challenge is over so sorry\u201d with no ability to reply without creating a whole new inquiry. Which is a process that I don\u2019t care to repeat for 5 measly coins.","822":"I really loved this app! I love reading the comics, but then all of a sudden I can\u2019t read the new releases! I thought waiting the week for the new episode to come out was enough, now I have wait additional days to read the next episode that\u2019s out already, just because if I don\u2019t purchase the coins I can\u2019t read them. I don\u2019t like spending money on apps, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I can\u2019t read them freely anymore. It was a 5 star rating when I first downloaded, but now because I have to buy the episodes or wait the grace period, it is down to a 3. It\u2019s getting a 3 because I still love the comics.","823":"Ok first thing first i love lumine and days of hana best stories EVER!! I just wish that it updated more but i know thats not on you its on the creators. I only wish that there where more anime like True beauty or Lumine or Days of Hana.

Many amazing comics were posted on here and still are being posted. \n\nNow, after the policy, more and more yaoi comics are being taken down due to not being able to censor things. \nComics like Obnoxious Hero Kun and many others are being taken down due to this factor. Now, most BLs don\u2019t stand a chance to become a real comic due to this. Many chapters of hard work are being deleted because they can\u2019t have them on there. Creators ideas are also being thrown away because it would get their comic taken down. \n\nPlease, share this news if you really care. Help save the comics many of us Yaoi readers hold dear to our hearts. \n\nDon\u2019t download this app if you don\u2019t like this new rule set in place, you will only be faced with disappointment","825":"I first found Line Webtoons through adds. At first I didn\u2019t think any thing of it until someone recommended it to me. I got the app and first started reading Super Secret, (which soon became my favorite comic) I read more and more and the app makes it so easy to just sit down and read. The adds barely pop up and when they do you can just exit, which I love. I love this app, it has even inspired me to write a comic of my own! Fantastic app, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be deleting it any time soon. Or ever!","826":"Normally I\u2019d give this app a 5\/5, because I use it on the daily and it\u2019s one of my favourite online comic apps, but as of recent I\u2019ve been having a bug where webtoon just randomly kicks me out of the app whenever I try to click on an episode (regardless of the webtoon). I tried deleting and re-downloading it, i tried restarting my phone, and I tried making more space on my phone, but nothing works. Now I can\u2019t read any webtoons, so the app is pretty much useless. Does anyone have any tips or something that might help fix the bug?","827":"Webtoon needs to leave Wattpad alone. Wattpad is a 17+ app for a reason and there is so need to make it kid friendly when it\u2019s not directed to that audience. It\u2019s like giving Snapchat to a fifth grader. If a parent or guardian decides to allow that, then that\u2019s their own parenting choice, but the app\u2019s already existing audience doesn\u2019t need to change. Changing the app will lose many of your users. Instead of ridding the app of well written stories because children will be using the app, maybe change the guidelines surrounding mature books; make people put their age when signing up as a user and then they can\u2019t get into certain books. If a user lies about their age and then dislikes the content, then that\u2019s sort of their issue.","828":"Webtoon Definitely deserves 5 stars. A lot of other Webcomics\/Mangas are very similar and can become boring reading the same thing over and over again. It has many stories that can attract so many different people. They have mystery, romance, sci fi. You name  it they have it, and anyone can upload a comic. So the variety is huge. I definitely recommend especially if you don\u2019t like books, but want to read something quick and easy that is very entertaining. :)","829":"You aren\u2019t making people come back... you\u2019re making them google the comics to get around it. Go back to the old system! Free like WEBTOON was made for! I\u2019m sure the creators of the series would not appreciate how you have ruined the app and forced us to migrate platforms. I don\u2019t even want a snarky dev comment as you know I\u2019m right. It was free before it should still be free. \n\nIt\u2019s like giving someone a Christmas gift and then asking for payment a month later. This daily pass scheme has been applied to comics I have already read before! This is just low...","830":"I love WEBTOON because of the great stories and it was free. Plus it was different from all the other comic apps that made you read two free episodes and have to pay for the rest. Now they webtoon is trying to be like them. Why the daily pass on completed comics? I can\u2019t even reread the ones I used to go back and read all the time. My most favorite ones for example noblesse, ghost wife, and untouchable. I can\u2019t even go and read them back no more because of the daily passes. I know most of the people who use webtoon don\u2019t like the daily pass either. I want the old webtoon back.","831":"The wait for these episodes I can get.a week is understandable, because by the time you finish that episode, there is another. But please get rid of the daily pass thing. Me and literally all 20 of my friends hate it. If we want to rewatch a completed series, we have to wait a day for each episode, it\u2019s stupid because some people get so annoyed with the daily pass that they don\u2019t come back to this app. They wait for a period of time and forget about it. I don\u2019t know about others but most of us hate daily pass. Please get rid of it... no ones going to see this XD","832":"I\u2019ve been using Webtoon for a while now and liked how everything was free. All the other webcomic apps were \u201cfree\u201d but really weren\u2019t due to people having to pay for the chapters in the app. Webtoon used to be different but now they\u2019re adding daily pass to already completed series. They were free a year ago but now I have to pay for most of their chapters. I was ok with there being fast pass because it didn\u2019t really change my experience with the app but now with daily pass a lot has changed. It\u2019s becoming exactly like all the other apps out there and doing the exact opposite of what made this app different and better.","833":"Whenever a \u201cdiscover\u201d webtoon gets put on the main page, naturally it gains more followers and maybe gets featured. However, when it does, your favorite discover webtoon suddenly gets either halted or completely erased. Then, they move the new one and begin from episode 1 only releasing about 6 episodes. This usually happens to one that has 40+ episodes on it. The comment section is also a whole heaping pile of garbage. Literally just obnoxious fan girls saying the same phrases. Maybe have a comment limiter where if it\u2019s like the other 10k comments, don\u2019t let them comment? Webtoon used to be amazing, used to have really cute stories. Now it\u2019s a cash grab, and all the good authors keep going on really long hiatus.","834":"I am a HUGE yaoi fan, but when they added the stricter rules for webtoons I couldn\u2019t read any. Which I can understand why they would do this as there are a lot of younger teens who read webtoon, but I want my yaoi! I don\u2019t have enough money to support the author to get the nsfw scenes so I want the nsfw rules gone! I think maybe Webtoon should make an update to make people verify their age? Sorry if I come off rude, I just want free yaoi. Again I am not that well off so when I had the free yaoi on webtoon I overjoyed me, I just wish they would let the author make nsfw scenes again!","835":"I used to love this app, I didn\u2019t even mind the \u201cwatch ad to view episode\u201d option but the daily pass is a NIGHTMARE! how the hella am i supposed to catch up on webtoons i had been reading now?! it\u2019s gonna take forever, i also don\u2019t have money to buy coins!\n\n1) i can reread episodes whenever i want \n2) if a series u had been reading is completed and u want to catch up, u can\u2019t just catch up on the webtoon in a day, it\u2019ll take forever!\n3) it\u2019s also a mess if u don\u2019t have a daily pass and also don\u2019t have coins to spend","836":"I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic but this app literally changed my life. There are thousands of incredibly high quality comics with beautiful art, engaging storylines, and lovable characters. There are genres for everyone (I\u2019m a romance girl myself) but if you like sci-fi, that\u2019s awesome! There\u2019s hundreds of comics for you! Literally any genre you can think of they have. I cannot recommend this app enough. If you love reading then you\u2019ll love this app. Heck, if you HATE reading you\u2019ll love this app. So what are you waiting for? Go download it!","837":"I have been enjoying WEBTOON for a while and I found it great. The one thing that bothers me is that lots of my favorite discover authors are taking down episodes and having to stop the series for the new NSFW policy. I believe it\u2019s up to the reader to choose whether they can read mature content. I understand wanting to keep younger people from reading mature content but maybe you can make it instead a warning. I already know that when I enter a WEBTOON with mature content there\u2019s a warning saying that there is mature content and confirming I am of age (19+ I believe). So if there is proper warning that says it has mature content I don\u2019t see why it has to be taken down.","838":"Webtoon used to be amazing. You could read and publish comics for free, and small creators could earn money from Patreon from their readers. When you added in fastpass, it got worse. The whole point of webtoon was to read online comics for free! Fastpass took that away. Then you added an ad equivalent to canvas. I didn\u2019t mind that because it didn\u2019t cost money but it still earned money for the creators. But then, daily pass. Daily pass is the worst of all three, because you can\u2019t binge read a finished story unless you want to spend money. \nYou had something perfect and you ruined it.","839":"I love webtoons and might\u2019ve rated this app 5 stars, but the daily pass feature is ruining it. Daily pass is just another way for the company running webtoon to leech cash out of its frustrated userbase and it\u2019s really sad to see. The system only allows a reader to unlock two episodes per day, and to make things much worse, those episodes are only available to read for 14 days. Only 14! What\u2019s the point of using the pass if it doesn\u2019t last forever? I don\u2019t recommend buying into this app for the sole purpose of reading completed works; if you\u2019re looking to re-read a finished series, look elsewhere.","840":"I\u2019m Absolutely Head Over Heals in Love with WEBTOON. Starting About a Year After I Got WEBTOON, I Starting Reading BoysLove Because I was Interested in it and it Made me Happy. Yet Shortly After, I Started Seeing that a Lot of the BoysLove Authors I Read from Were Upset with Some Policy. \n\nI Completely Understand Why There\u2019s a Policy on Mature Content. Minors Read WEBTOON Comics and Aren\u2019t Supposed to See Something too. . .You Get the Point. \n\nHowever, I Also See Where the Authors are Coming from. They Want to Draw What they Want to Draw. They Want to Make Their Readers Happy by Providing Something Interesting to Their Stories. That\u2019s Great! Comics Need a Little Topsy Tervy Every Now and Again!\n\nSo All I\u2019m Really Saying, is that if a Comic Says Mature Content and Has the Little Screen that Pops Up Whenever You Are About to Enter a Comic with Mature Content, it Shouldn\u2019t Have the Policy Blocking it from Being Mature Content. (Romance Wise, Anyway)","841":"Love the comics and such, but recently they\u2019ve been doing this thing with free coins where they let you get up to 3, but you can\u2019t do anything with 3, you need 5 to do a fast pass. If you win more free coins before your others expire you get to keep them and actually use them. But they waited until right after the last set from the last event expired to do the next event. So that we just run around and do the event and end up with nothing because that\u2019s the point.","842":"Every time there something saying like read 100 story\u2019s get 5 coins... which 5 coins ONLY gets you one fast pass. I read over 100 now. Given yeah I found some new ones I like exploring but I\u2019ve also spent a decent amount of money I. There to fast pass. It stoped working at 99... I want my 5 coins. It did the same thing for the promos around thanksgiving or Christmas not tracking my progress. But I just blew it off. I\u2019m now annoyed I got all excited thinking I got fast pass on one of my favorite stories but no... also knocking it down back to two stars because there no where to report problems or ask for help. Stories are good though. App is annoying.","843":"I\u2019ve used this app for about two-three years now, and it\u2019s been so incredibly amazing. I\u2019ve been a dedicated reader and never missed a single day (I\u2019m proud to say that I read, on average, 70 webtoons per week) but lately I\u2019ve had trouble getting onto the app. When I press it, it brings up the loading screen and sits for about a full minute before crashing. I haven\u2019t been able to do anything on it this whole week.\n\nIs this something I should ask for help for?","844":"I really love WEBTOON, I think it\u2019s a great idea and an amazing place to allow people to be discovered through their art. The only thing I wish it has is a reader\u2019s archive. So if the reader finishes reading a comic we would have the ability to archive it so it doesn\u2019t pop up in our subscription section to have a better idea of what we have already finished. I hope it could be in a different sub-section like subscription, fast-pass, and comments are.","845":"I love WEBTOON sooooo much and read stories on it every day, but after the most recent update, I\u2019ve been having an issue where upon launch, it will be perfectly fine for about two seconds and then it will freeze and won\u2019t start moving again. With this being the case, I can no longer read anything on it, as I can\u2019t launch any episodes or even scroll on over to the series. I was wondering if you could possibly help.","846":"Do I really have to wait 13 DAYS for 1 episode? That\u2019s ridiculous honestly. Get this app if you like waiting i guess. the stories are super good and I\u2019ve been on it for hours but why you gotta do me like this \ud83d\ude2dI really wish I didn\u2019t have to wait 39 days in total. I am not patient if I wanna watch something and finish it I wanna watch something and finish it. I\u2019m broke why you gotta expect me to have money \ud83d\ude39? A good way is to read other stories but once I do that I forget all about what happened in the recent one so like idek anymore \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41","847":"I\u2019ve had the same everything for over a year now and I opened the app a few weeks ago and all my series, comments, and coins were just gone. You can see all the episodes I\u2019ve already read but all my stuff is gone. I reached out to the support team and they told me there\u2019s no record of my account or purchases with them and I\u2019d have to reach out to apple for a refund. That was after almost 2 weeks of my report to them. I wrote back saying it wasn\u2019t ok and they needed to fix their issue since this is obviously an issue many are having and I\u2019ve yet to hear anything back. This review will stay at one star until this issue is remedied. Shame on you WEBTOON","848":"I have always loved WEBTOON. It was the best platform to read on that did not require you to pay. I understand paying for fast pass episodes and seeing content before others who haven\u2019t paid. (I have spent money to do this) now you want coins for every episode?!? Or wait so many days to be able to read. This is my saving grace in this stressful world. Being able to binge read and forget my daily life and be able to escape reality. Now I can\u2019t do that. I have bills to pay first. I can\u2019t buy coins every now and then as a reward to splurge on fast passes. Now it\u2019s just another app that\u2019s falling under peer pressure to be like all the other comics apps. Seriously dissatisfied with the new experience.","849":"Hello there! im soon going to post my own comic series. I love Webtoon and it's creators and it brings so much creativity!\n\nNow I just have ONE single issue. Why cant I post on my mobile devices such as Iphone or Ipad? sometimes I have logged in on the Website and it doesnt let me, plus I also dont have a computer which I cant post there. I would highly appreciate if you let us post through the app because not all creators have the access of a computer to post there.\n\nIf you do, thank you! I will be so grateful \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f","850":"I\u2019ve tried to make an account for about 10 minutes. Everything went well and did the verification thing. When I went to log in, it said that my email isn\u2019t registered. So I re-tried making an account with that email, guess what? It said the email was taken. Take better care of your app and fix that glitch. I had to make an extra edit to this, I can\u2019t search anything. The only reason I downloaded this Webtoon app was only to just look at the Love Alarm since I was obsessed with the series on Netflix.","851":"I have been having this app for a while now, I mean a couple years but yk, and I recently got a new phone and gotten the account I have been using to read but I noticed only some of the comics have been added to my list thingy again and I\u2019m getting really frustrated by that because I really liked some of the comics and would like to know how they ended so please if you deleted them or something add that back or if this is just a bug please fix it. But otherwise I am pretty happy with this app and really enjoy it","852":"I really love this App and have actually been using it for a few years now so I would highly recommend it. Only thing is that lately it seems like there\u2019s a glitch when I try to use it. I can\u2019t push certain buttons anymore and it doesn\u2019t open any of my favorite WEBTOON for some reason. This just started happening about a week ago and I\u2019ve never had this problem before then. Would be awesome if they could fix it because I haven\u2019t been able to access any of my favorites.","853":"This is outstanding, but I have one problem with this: Mobile people can't upload their works on here. I am a Mobile person who got excited when I found out real people make the Webtoons, but I got disappointed when I found out you need a computer to do this. I draw better on Mobile than Computer. Is there a way you can change this? It would really be helpful. I also am working on a Webtoon called Fates Abound and I can't publish on vacation due to being a Iphone user.","854":"Ready to find yourself hooked on Webtoons? When you find the right one for you, it can be really exciting and you may get anxious for your favorite to update. It\u2019s a good way to spend your time but if you want to access it without internet, make sure you download the ones you want to read. It\u2019s a wonderful way to spend time when you\u2019re bored and you like comics. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s free. ( You can buy to see the next episode of your comic early, though )","855":"This app has so many free webtoons you can read that I am honestly so thankful for. They have great stories, great art, and a great platform for those who want to start as a webtoon creator. I can\u2019t believe that throughout the years they have not asked you a dime for any of the thousands of chapters they have (exception for fast pass webtoons of course). Everyone who likes reading webcomics should honestly download this app and start reading everything from the completed series to that of the ongoing ones. Great app!","856":"Ok so I didn\u2019t get to read anything! When I tried to read some comics it didn\u2019t let me it kept saying that my network wasn\u2019t working but when onto other apps my network was working! When I put my email address it kept saying that it was already like registered but I have never had this app before and never have downloaded it on any other phone! I kept trying but it didn\u2019t work I asked for help that didn\u2019t work either! So I am asking to fix this bug because now I can\u2019t read any comics that interested me! Please fix this!!!                                                                                        -from somebody who couldn\u2019t read anything from trying everything","857":"i\u2019ve found some incredible comics on here- theyre visually appealing with good writing. however, its exceedingly difficult to keep finding good new comics. there are tons of comics that are constantly \u201ctop rated\u201d or promoted, but typically the art work is low quality and juvenile at best. i have a hard time believing many of the comics with top ratings really earned them. it seems a little bit like deviantart (if anyone remembers that) but devoted purely to comics. maybe my critique is of the artists and of the general consumption of what I view as really hideous artwork at times. i guess i just wish that there was some standard.","858":"So I just updated the app and I have to sign in?!? And now all of the WEBTOONs I\u2019ve subscribed to are now unsubscribed, so I have to go back to each of them and manually subscribe to them again. That\u2019s so annoying, I\u2019m sub to so many webtoons. It would take ages to resub to all of them.\n\nEdit: And even when I do resub, why does it keep unsubing. So complicated, wish we didn\u2019t have that update. That update is just causing a lot of problems & complications. :\/ Sad, cuz there are so many good WEBTOONs but I don\u2019t want to have to deal with any complications. I just want to read. Think imma just delete this app again and come back when it\u2019s less complicated.","859":"It was awesome! A few comics I recommend are as follows: Lore Olympus, Tales of The Unusual, and The Red Book. I also recommend Brutally Honest, if horror and romance arent your thing. I didnt enjoy reading a certain romance comic, mostly because it had a lot ( i mean A LOT) of innapropriate type of things in it, and it had some blood and gore, and it never gave you any warning about any s*xual content. I also didnt like that there was a lot of racist and homophobic content in the comic. I still love the app and i use it all the time!","860":"I like it it\u2019s just the videos to watch in order to read or the fast passes it\u2019s kinda annoying I\u2019m not sure if anyone else is having a problem but when I try to open the app now it seems to exit back the my home screen and I\u2019ve even tried to reset my phone to see if that\u2019s the problem but it wasn\u2019t and I\u2019ve left the app alone for a good week or so and it still won\u2019t open if you can fix this that would be nice other than that I think this is a great app.","861":"I absolutely love webtoon and have had it a little less than half a year. But sometimes when I\u2019m scrolling the pages or just even clicking the app, it crashes. Just today, I was clicking on the app like 10 times and not even 1 second of loading, it would crash. Even after restarting my phone, it still wouldn\u2019t work. And I don\u2019t want to delete the app. My phone is not an old version nor the app. It made me really mad to have to take a star off because this app is my savior.","862":"It\u2019s definitely an amazing app. I love reading comics on it, the stories on it have definitely inspired me A LOT. The app is generally easy to use, and makes it easier to find comics. Although as of late I haven\u2019t been able to access the app. It\u2019s stuck on the webtoon screen when you first open the app. Maybe I just have to wait longer but it\u2019s been like this for almost a week? I\u2019m not sure it might have been the update? But I decided I\u2019ll just wait it out.","863":"Hey I Just that the app is awesome it\u2019s a good way to pass the time during the pandemic and there are some good webcomics on there but there is one thing I\u2019m confuse with p free pass or a daily pass because I was able to read up to 1-12 or 14 chapters so I don\u2019t know if I accidentally got a free pass or a daily pass and I\u2019m just wondering because I don\u2019t want to Spend any money(I\u2019m saving money during the pandemic) so I\u2019m just wondering if you can explain this to me -\n\nFrom a new WEBTOON user","864":"I\u2019d love to sing my praises of the stories on here to the heavens except for one thing. Right now the app\u2019s glitches so that the moment I pull up a story (not even the panels of the comic itself, but just the menu where you select the episode) it glitches and I can\u2019t read the comic or close out of that menu back to the main screen. I just want the problem fixed. I hope it\u2019s just me who has to delete then reinstall this app every day to read stuff for a few hours","865":"Absolutely love this app and it is my favorite to look at everyday but since the update i cant load anything on it. Every time i try to click anything it just freezes up on me and i have to force close the app. Tried restating my phone or re-downloading the app but now ive just signed myself out and its not letting me click on anything to try to sign back in. I do not like giving this incredible app such a bad review but im not sure where else to report this issue.... however the second its resolved i plan to rate it 5 stars! Please fix the app!!","866":"Recently, whenever I read Webtoons, I\u2019m constantly kicked out of the app to my web browser and shown an ad? I\u2019ve double checked this multiple times, and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m actually clicking on any ads. I could be scrolling through an episode and a loading image will randomly pop up before booting me out. Is this supposed to happen? If not, please fix it. And if this is just happening to me, then yikes.","867":"Don\u2019t understand why there is about to be a new policy where you are only able to read one chapter of a completed comic a day, or pay to read the rest. The only time I could see coins being worth it is if you wanted to read ahead of what has been updated already. There are already advertisements on every comic (some that even force you to another page\/take over sound on your device) so why is the coin system being forced on users? The stars that I did give are for the amazing creators on the app. Not sure how much longer I\u2019ll use WEBTOON if the advertisements become more aggressive.","868":"This app is aiming to be child friendly. While it is sad that some artists' work has gotten taken down because of the NSFW content, artists should make sure their work is suitable for children's eyes now that the policy has become known. If you are a person who needs NSFW content in order to feel entertained, maybe this app isn't for you. But I l don't mind this policy as I actually don't care for NSFW content in my webtoons or even my movies and dramas. So I give this app 5 stars.","869":"I\u2019ve used Webtoons for awhile but it seems they\u2019ve changed some policy\u2019s and it\u2019s honestly gotten in the way creators should be aloud to share links or even mention there social media they give you so much traffic so it only seems fair and I get censorship of certain things being too far but the extent the rules take it now is too far it impedes creative freedom and plot lines many creators are thinking of not using webtoon anymore and honestly a lot of my favorite comics are on the discover page and those seem to be struggling with the new changes the most and if they stop making content for webtoons I\u2019ll stop using it. Also I wouldn\u2019t mind if I could subscribe to more than 100 discover comics.","870":"Love the app and all of the content! Plus the community is great. \n\nOne thing I wanted to bring to the app creators\/maintainers is that it would be great if there was another option with the \u201cRecent\u201d, \u201cSubscribed\u201d, \u201cDownloaded\u201d, \u201cUnlocked\u201d, and \u201cComments\u201d carousel that said \u201cAdded\u201d or \u201cYou Added\u201d something like that. That would show the most recent stories the user has subscribed to. Or maybe there is a way to add a filter field within the \u201cSubscribed\u201d tab to do that.","871":"Okay so first of I\u2019m doing super well with webtoon and I absolutely love this, but as it was updating I went to click it and it would kick me out of the whole app, I found myself having to delete it and I still couldn\u2019t get it back and what was even worse I had lost everything it told me i would lose everything I had read and anything else which was really disappointing and I still can\u2019t get back in as if right now please fix this issue I don\u2019t want other people having the same problem and having to reread their comics","872":"I enjoy reading primarily on my iPad Pro. Since I have the magic keyboard, portrait orientation is rather cumbersome, however, WEBTOON does not support landscape orientation except in the actual episodes and even then, I have to force the reorientation by rotating my iPad 90 degrees and then back each time I move to a new episode. Like I said, I love reading WEBTOONs, I would just really love the app to support a landscape orientation on all screens and not default to the portrait orientation when I move to a new episode. Thank you for considering my feedback. I will happily change my rating should the app include these updates!","873":"This app has been working great for the past few years I\u2019ve had it but now for some reason it freezes up and won\u2019t load when there\u2019s a new episode or won\u2019t let me get off the main menu. It\u2019s been happening for a few months now and it\u2019s getting kinda annoying that I have to get out of it. Load up the episode. Episode freezes have to get out of it and so on so on. It\u2019s just really annoying and I would like to have the bug fixed as soon as possible please. Thank you","874":"I\u2019m giving this 3 stars because it\u2019s never done this before. Now, every time I do ANYTHING involving opening a webtoon, it acts like I\u2019m off WiFi and data\u2014 and the worst part is, I can\u2019t even get the back arrow to work! It only works when I go to the website through google! I\u2019ve reset my phone twice, and it didn\u2019t fix anything. \n\nEdit: I DUNNO WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE FIXED ITSELF. Yesterday I managed to get into the comments and since then it just takes a long time to load.","875":"This app is great! You can read all the comics without having to pay to read after a trial. You do have to use \u201cFast Pass\u201d to read the newest chapters if you don\u2019t want to wait but you also don\u2019t have to; you can wait until it comes available. Usually it\u2019s every week, some are 2x a week. I can\u2019t find another app where I don\u2019t have to pay to read the content. \n\nAlso the artist are great! I love finding new creators and seeing what they create!","876":"I really love reading on this app, but I wish that we didn\u2019t have to pay to read new episodes, because I hate having to wait a whole week for the next episode, especially if the new episodes are small. I wish we could like do tasks like read enough for forty minutes or send a link to a friend, so we could earn some coins or something to use as fast pasts because I can\u2019t buy them cause I\u2019m a teenager. If we could have something like then I would give this 5 stars.","877":"Hello my name is Ivy and I had this app for a very long time now and I Love it! But today their was a problem with me logging in \ud83d\ude13 when I type in my email and password it\u2019s telling me that this email hasn\u2019t been registered so I decided to sign up again and this time I put in the same email and when I pushed sign up it\u2019s telling me \u201cthis email has already been registered\u201d... I don\u2019t know what the problem is but it\u2019s telling me two different things. Please help me","878":"A lot of the stories available on the app are translated from Korean. Unfortunately, the translators are clearly not native English speakers. There\u2019s incorrect grammar and awkward English galore. There are stories on the app that have perfect English, and those are usually the ones that were actually created by native English speakers to begin with. \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating when an interesting premise is ruined by bad English, and it\u2019s rather disheartening that the company is pushing them as the official translations. Like, I said, there are stories available that aren\u2019t riddled with errors, but if you don\u2019t want to have to go fishing for them, then I suggest looking elsewhere for entertainment.","879":"I spend all of my time either reading webtoons or listening to musicals (I\u2019m a total nerd.) If you are trying to decide on a good app for amazing comics, this one is definitely the one you should choose for sure!! I have had this app for about 4 years on anything I can have it on. I have to say that I don\u2019t like the new policy with the coins and stuff, but otherwise it\u2019s fantabulous!! Please take the time to read these fantastic stories and maybe even make one yourself!!","880":"Ok so the way I will put it is that there should be like a Dailey thing cause I am into this story I need coins and since I got none then I have to wait like 12 days for the next one and it is ridiculously annoying and my friend too like bruh I have to find other comic apps and then when I am on time than it says \u201ccoming soon\u201d after I waited like 17 days for oh and you guys should update it I only like 2 of the comics on there because I get bored sooo easily so I just think there should be more updates","881":"Webtoon was absolutely great but I heard about a New Policy that webtoons has, which removes content that is reported as NSFW. I don't even know what NSFW is until now, but it is awful to learn that webtoons has become a little b1tch that removes great material just because of the some content that is rated 18+. If thats the case, everyone should just report everything so that there is nothing left to read, and then perhaps webtoons will realize that the NEW POLICY does not suit webtoons in the first place. C'mon webtoons! Just be yourself and don't let the lame opinions of the few (idiots who choose to ignore MATURE content warnings) ruin what you do and who you are. Seriously, why would the opinions of moronic buffoons matter? Remove the policy!","882":"I absolutely enjoy WEBTOON. It\u2019s has to be one of the most time consuming, in a good way that is. But the new policy has me a bit upset. To be honest most of the webcomics I read revolve around boys lover or yaoi. And most of thes have a couple of mature scenes, but the authors know what to show and what not to show. It\u2019s also a big part of there passion. I\u2019m an artist myself, not professional but I hope to be one day. You are losing some of the most inspirational people you can have on the app. Maybe you should fix your policy so more artists and newcomers will stay. To be honest I\u2019ve had this app for at least a year or a half and I love it to death but you are running my best experience with this app, so please fix the policy.","883":"I have used WEBTOON for over a year now and I fell in love with it. I think it is easy to access comics and it is easy to keep track of everything I read (which is a LOT). \nHonestly I would have given it 5 stars but they recently added a new policy that heavily limits the creativity of the creator. Pretty much all NSFW stuff isn\u2019t allowed even when censored and having an age warning added. That really impacts the storyline and I feel bad for all the creators who either have to change their comic completely, delete old posts, or have gotten so discouraged that they\u2019re thinking about leaving WEBTOON.","884":"Like a bunch of your fans on here, whom you don\u2019t seem to be listening to since this daily pass has been a thing for about a year now, I absolutely hate it. I don\u2019t see the point in it. It\u2019s only used for series that are completed, and have been completed for a long time. Why make us purchase a daily pass, by the way, if it\u2019s only good for two weeks? It\u2019s especially inconvenient for Webtoons that have hundreds of episodes to read. It\u2019s very inefficient and I sincerely hope that you will fix this and make it the WEBTOON that it was before. Thank you.","885":"I love the app I\u2019ve had it for 2 years and there is something\u2019s I\u2019ve noticed \n1. The downloading- I have a phone but no SIM card currently so I like to download things when I get the chance but it takes like half an hour for one download \n2. Daily pass- I don\u2019t think I need to say anything but I finished a series and like 7 months later I decide I need to re read it but but they decided to lock all the episodes again and want us to pay to unlock and release an episode every week\n3. The commenting- I\u2019m not sure how to put this by not sounding petty but I soon as an episode is released I get their as fast as possible but there are comments made on their from like a month ago. Which is annoying because everyone want a chance to tell their ideas and get top comment but unless you by 3 fast passes your out of luck\n\n- still love WEBTOON tho \u263a\ufe0f","886":"I give it a four star bc when I what to read it it tell me to\nSigned it in and I got so scared bc I really what to read it i do my email and password but it didn\u2019t work I hope that won\u2019t happen and if it did I would give it one or zero star I\u2019m vary disappointed \ud83d\ude14 I wish nothing cost money \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d why do I neeed to signs up I don\u2019t what tooooooo and I don\u2019t what to comment either I just what to have fun reading it whyyyyyyhhhyyyyyy I love that comice until that thing comes up. \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d......I hate itt","887":"I just updated and I\u2019m having all kinds of problems. When opening the app it wants me to login. I enter the correct info but says it\u2019s incorrect. So I tried to reset my password by clicking the link no email was ever sent (I tried it twice) so I skipped the login but now it says I have no internet on the app! I checked setting but it\u2019s on. And to even post this I need internet so clearly some bug is really messing up this app. I love WEBTOON and this one the only times I\u2019ve ever had an issue with this app. Please fix this!","888":"I have always liked them this app, it was convenient and accessible, with a lot of manhwas and comics, but with the new update it\u2019s just plain annoying how now I can\u2019t read more than 10 episodes without waiting after a whole day for just one chapter, the whole fast pass thing was alright, it was your decision if you wanted to pay up to read more of a new story, but making you wait or Pay for a completed story is just greedy, I see the point of view from the creators, they might need money, so they did this, but this will just make people to pirate comics out of the app, and in the long run lose money.\nJust reverse the daily pass thing and people will be happy again.","889":"Well lately I\u2019ve realized that most of the content I read is for a more mature audience and WEBTOON has decided that it\u2019s better to take that off, what I\u2019m referring to is NSFW, I hate that they sensor it and I hope that thins app will have a system soon where I and fellow NSFW fans can read it. I\u2019ve also noticed the new coin system.... long story short it\u2019s where you can\u2019t get read a new chapter earlier, you have buy it with the coins, for me it\u2019s ok, I work but I know some KIDS that have this app and don\u2019t work and maybe their parents or guardian don\u2019t want to buy them coins.","890":"I really enjoy reading comics on WEBTOON but I have two problems the first is the rules about adult content. It should be up to the reader if it\u2019s appropriate or not two and my mine \u201cproblem\u201d it\u2019s that stories are only updated once a week, meaning I have to follow a story for years to completely read it and as someone who reads often this is infuriating. I started a story last night that started in 2016 and is currently still going. Other wise they content is great and the app is a good place for people to put their stories up.","891":"I love this app and all the stories, however they\u2019ve been doing little contests that pop up and give you the chance to earn coins, usually through reading certain series. Now they\u2019ve done this for a while, but recently the pop ups never load and will more often force quit the app when they pop up. I would write about this to them, but I don\u2019t see anywhere you can send in problems. Other than that it\u2019s great.","892":"I was looking for another comic app similar to webcomics, but after reading the reviews, I will be deleting this app. Unfortunate to hear that some artists had to quit their pieces due to a new policy about mature content. I can understand if these artists were producing actual porn only content, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m getting from in these reviews. If family friendly is what this app wants to be, they will be losing a lot of talented artist and loyal fans. The last thing I want to do is find a new favorite read to only have it be taken down or having parts of the story missing because an underwear shot happened one time out of 10 chapters. Come over to webcomics for mature content guys!","893":"I have loved Webtoon since the moment I downloaded it. However, the recent policy changes have effected my experience in an extremely negative way, and many of the creators that I love are unable to publish their work in the manner they originally intended, which is ruining the feel of the stories. I\u2019ve considered uninstalling the app, since many of my favorite authors are having a hard time portraying their work properly with the new policies in effect. I hope the creators of the app rethink these new rules and change them back, or at least loosen them a little bit. They took a big stab at some of their larger creators.","894":"I still love his app I really do but, since the policy has been changed, it\u2019s basically stopping creators from creating. It won\u2019t a effect a few people but for many, it will. I didn\u2019t read the WEBTOON for the NSFW content, but in a romance storyline, it was nice on occasion when it helped progress the plot. Now, according to the new policy, you can even depict it. Originally it was fine if you censored it but now you can even do that. This leaves many creators having to rewrite parts of their story and have gaps in plot where it may have happened in the past. Many people are moving to other platforms and the whole community is falling apart.","895":"This is one of the best apps I have ever tried. The app in general is amazing the only thing that isn\u2019t good well its nothing in my opinion the app is a great way for you to read comics and have a laugh plus there are a ton of options to choose from and it seems endless there are so many possibilities that you will read something that truly captures your attention and makes you want to keep reading, for me this app is 5 out of 5 stars","896":"I have loved WEBTOON for years! But the most recent update has significantly impacted my use of it. Every time I open it, it is frozen on the coin page for 2 minutes before it will load. Just a blank page to tell me about a free coin reading promotion. It is so disruptive to reading. And heaven forbid I elect to participate to get free coins and have to wait at the end of each episode for several minutes while it is frozen. Please fix this bug. I love your app but waiting several minutes each time I read a single episode isn\u2019t feasible.","897":"Ever since the new update, I keep getting message pop up of \u201cnew phone\u201d found on account and if I\u2019d like to deregister this phone to add the new phone to account but I\u2019ve never used another phone for this app.... \n On top of that, when I\u2019m finishing reading a chapter, going towards the end, it goes into black screen and times out the app to where it closes and when I reopen I have to go back to the chapter and scroll all the way down to read the ending but does the same thing over again. \n\nMaybe bug issues?? Idunno but I deleted app and re-downloaded it but still doing the same thing.","898":"I don\u2019t really have any complaints but one suggestion. \n\nI really wish there was a section on WEBTOON where we can see the webtoons we\u2019ve fully completed. That way, we can see what we\u2019ve read and not lose it, just in case we want to read it again. And it\u2019d be located in the My Series tab with all the other selections like recent, unlocked, downloads and subscribed.\n\nBesides that one thing, I love webtoon and all the different type of stories there are. \u2764\ufe0f","899":"I\u2019ve had this app for soooooo long. I\u2019ve loved reading all the comics on it (well no duh that\u2019s what the app is) but with this update they made completed comics impossible to read without paying. You either have to wait to read a chapter a day or pay to read them and only temporarily be able to read said chapter. You only get to read it for 14 days and after that you have to pay again. I get it\u2019s to support the artists because they work extremely hard, I get it, but this is too far.","900":"I used to and I still do absolutely love Webtoon. I'm on the app every single day. However, now when I want to go back and read completed comics to relive old memories I'm faced with a daily pass. What? I know for a fact I could go back and re-read webcomics without having a daily pass to worry about not getting over a cliff hanger or something. Reminds me of Tapas.. I'm not the only one who doesn't enjoy the Daily Pass. I really hope that Webtoon takes this into account and discusses upon it. Thank you for your time.","901":"It\u2019s an amazing app that lets me pass time and has really amazing artists\/storytellers but the app seemed to stop working\n1.) When I open it, it only stays on the green \u201cWebtoon\u201d loading page. I usually have to close out the app completely to get it to work\n2.) Ever since about 2 days ago I cant seem to like chapters or look at comments anymore. It just freezes and it always says there are 0 comments when I know that\u2019s not true\n\nI tried to reinstall the app to see if it would work but it didn\u2019t:(","902":"I had a new phone and I was resubscribing my favorite webtoons. While I was subscribing to my fav completed series I see episodes that are locked. Hmmm??? I\u2019ve been reading comics on WEBTOON since the beginning. It was so much fun to read series from the very beginning or even skipping to the best chapters. Many of my favorite series including girls of the wild\u2019s, unTouchable, days of Hana, a good day to be a dog and Cheese in the Trap have been \u201cDaily Passed\u201d. Why should series like these be locked by \u201cdaily pass\u201d when they were just like any other webtoon. It used to regularly update like any other webtoon too. Can you at least do binge events and unlock these chapters for at least a week??? \ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude3f","903":"I wish there was a way to filter my subscribed webtoons. For example: by last updated, by title, by author, by genre etc. \n\nAlso I wish that if I read the newest episode already that that webtoons would move to the bottom of my \"subscribed.\"  Im subscribe to a lot of webtoons and when I haven't had a chance to read them for a few days it's a little inconvenient to have to scroll all the way down to get past the ones that updated that day. OR that it would keep my place when scrolling.","904":"The best app I swear. I get that some people are unhappy that you have to wait a week or so to get the next episode but I think it adds suspense the story and you value each episode much more that way and that\u2019s the thing with fast passes, you fast pass three episodes and then have to wait a month until the next episode is available, deal w it.  10\/10 you should get, great stories to pass time especially during quarantine.","905":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for little over 2 years now, and was so excited to see a platform where creators could share there stories, and where us as readers could read it for free. But the newest update upsets me, I was binging girls of the wilds, and was able to get to chapter 161 in about 3-4 days. The update not only showed that I apparently only read up to chapter 60, but I also now have to pay to read the rest of the chapters, unless I want to wait to read 2 chapters a day, that are only yours for 14 days?! I MIGHT understand for a newer WEBTOON, but girls of the wilds has been up for YEARS! Very frustrating.","906":"WEBTOONS APP TAKES COINS YOUVE PAYED FOR!! HEAR ME OUT I\u2019m a huge fan of several stories specifically lore Olympus so I payed a pretty penny to get coins and I only got to spend FIVE coins before they disappeared with NO trace on the app itself, just on my card and on the App Store. this happened to me and I\u2019ve contacted twice, each time being told they\u2019d help and doing nothing about it. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS APP if you want to support the artists you like I\u2019d suggest finding their patreon, because this app will NOT help you with your losses. :(","907":"I\u2019ve been using this app for a few years now and I love it! Unfortunately there seems to be a bug where my screen freezes in between frames. Probably an easy fix but I felt like I would still try to bring some attention to it. Mostly because, at first, I thought it was my own phone that was acting up. But I\u2019ve seen other recent reviews that share the same problem.\nOther than that, it\u2019s great! The app is very easy to use, and it has a great system for the Featured vs Discovered comics.","908":"So! I really love Webtoons and all the great artists in it, but my issue is the 100 subscribes only most of the comics I've subscribed are either unfinished and still updating or future read but sadly there are more that are still updating but since I'm at the limit I can't add them and always miss their updates and I lose their titles and can't remember \nPls fix the limit it frustrates me to get the whole little message about the 100 mark it's really stupid enough to have to delete good webtoons just to subscribe to another","909":"I used to really love this app as the stories told here had a wide variety of content. It was easy to know which were going to have adult content as it would ask if your over 19. WEBTOON has now changed and made it banned that any adult content can be viewed. Honestly how are some authors who hav adult content supposed to get support for their comic if now their hands are tied so to speak on how they can tell their story. As soon as I find another website in which I can support my favorite authors I am going to leave WEBTOON and do just that. Very poor taste to change rules instead do a new web app for under 18 comics if that is the issue.","910":"I have really loved WEBTOON and I definitely still do, but the new policy has really shaken people up. I see many of my favorite stories are having to leave WEBTOON making it very hard to read them or even impossible. If the policy is to keep the content clean I think an adult section would be great and it\u2019s the persons choice to press yes or no on the age warning before a more mature story is opened. I personally am going to miss many stories and probably won\u2019t use WEBTOON as much. It\u2019s also very sad to have to see a story and in the middle out of no where. I originally would probably rate WEBTOON at a 4 or 5 but now I\u2019m rating this at a 2. Thank you for reading!","911":"This app was shared to me by some of my friends who had been reading comics and had much fun with the app. Once I started reading, I loved it! I enjoyed the creativity and work authors conveyed through their comics but something changed. Webtoon activated a new policy that limits the authors creativity with their own story and has discouraged many authors from continuing their comics. Many of my favorite comics have been discontinued because of the new policy since authors feel they dont have the freedom to write their stories the way that they want. I was totally in love with this app until the new policy was established and now I\u2019m hesitant to use it as often as I did before.","912":"There\u2019s something for everyone! There\u2019s horror and mystery, sports, slice of life, romance, even BL! There\u2019s even a couple about BTS~ Personally, I recommend Lookism. For sports, I love wind breaker. And for something Kpop? Lost in Translation, I LOVE IT! Anyways, I highly recommend this app to anyone who enjoys a good comic or graphic novel! Good design, nice community, and good content. Also, anything found as inappropriate is taken down, so don\u2019t worry about that... hope my review was helpful maybe? Thank you for reading! Bye~","913":"This app is amazing and I love to read it. It works well with my iOS and everything is great, but there is a slight problem. I have many interests and I want to add the Webtoons I like to my library but unfortunately, there is a limit to that. I wish I could add more Webtoons to my library so I wouldn\u2019t forget about them or have to write down the titles and then forget. I hope the next time the developers update to improve the Subscriptions limit. I really like the app and I don\u2019t want to download another app and go through the process of adding all the Webtoons to it.","914":"The daily pass for some finished comics needs to go I mean don\u2019t get me wrong but it\u2019s just annoying and I would love to go back and reread the series that I\u2019ve already read and it\u2019s annoying to and I\u2019ve also seen a bunch of other people complain about it to but if you\u2019re looking to download this app you definitely should it\u2019s an amazing app full of wonderful stories and a new comic pretty much comes out almost every day I don\u2019t know about any other peoples opinions but that\u2019s just mine","915":"first of all, I love this app. But, I was scrolling down a genre, when a comic caught my eye. I think it was \u201c a super villain day life. I clicked on it and it said Servers are interrupted or something like that. I spammed retry, bu said same thing. A Little while later, I tried to read the comic. Same result. Now, I still have the same result. And the first 50 or so episodes are not even showing. I used to be able to read 2 ep  But now they don\u2019t work. When I click on an ep, I don\u2019t start reading, and nothing happens.","916":"While Webtoon is normally a 5 star app, my app has been crashing constantly recently. It\u2019s been over a week since it started. Before it would only crash once in a while now it\u2019s multiple times during one chapter. Just now the app crashed and when I went back to read the same chapter, as soon as I started to scroll down, it crashed again. I\u2019ve already tried clearing cache and reinstalling. My iPhone is updated and so is the app. Nothing is working. For someone who has spent around $100 on coins, this is very annoying and tedious. I\u2019ve already contacted customer support. I\u2019ve never had a problem with crashes up until recently.","917":"I can\u2019t use my coins to unlock fast pass episodes after the latest update. It says it\u2019s detecting another device, but when I looked it\u2019s only detecting the very phone that is in my hand. Not about to make a new profile or anything-I\u2019ve got too many that I\u2019m subscribed to and I\u2019m halfway done with Yuma\u2019s Cells. But please fix this. I\u2019m betting you\u2019re seeing an immediate impact on the revenue from the fast pass program, and I\u2019m hoping that will prompt a swift response. But if not, I wanted to agree with other reviews on here and point out there is a bug.","918":"I love the stories on the app! My favorites being \u201cLore Olympus\u201d and \u201cThe Cursed Princess Club\u201d. However, recently I haven't been able to read any of them :( I would click on the series I would want to read and it would freeze. It wouldn\u2019t even let me go back. I refreshed the app dozens of times and it still freezes. I even deleted and redownloaded the app and it is now frozen even before I click on the story I want to read. I miss my stories and I want to keep on reading them. Please fix this ASAP!","919":"I love webtoon. It\u2019s a great app and I love all the comics to choose from. I wish we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for coins, though. Maybe there could be a way to earn coins by how many comics we read per day, or getting on the app every day? Rewards for completing a comic? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have any money, but I\u2019d really like a way to get some coins for a fast pass or daily pass. It would make many more people download the app and make it more enjoyable. Otherwise it\u2019s great!","920":"The reason why I gave WEBTOON 4 stars and not 5 because it\u2019s so annoying that I have to get fast pass to see the most recent episodes before WEBTOON had this update I gave it 5 stars when I first downloaded WEBTOON I was just like wow it\u2019s so much more different from other comic apps because we don\u2019t need to pay for anything but now WEBTOON is the same as all comic apps having to pay to buy some coins just to read my favorite comics. I\u2019m hoping in a future update WEBTOON would take fast pass off but besides the fast pass issue it\u2019s a good app.","921":"I tried to read the books I was reading and it would freeze and exit out of the whole thing and when I try to go back in it kicks me out. I deleted it and reinstalled it and all the things I had on my recent went away be my shelf was already full and I didn\u2019t mind finding all the ones I was reading but after 10 minutes it kicked me out again and again. So I re-deleted it again and i don\u2019t know if this time it will work. Please if this is a bug please fix it so I can enjoy WEBTOONs again and give it full stars.","922":"This is a nice app. It has all the comics you can read for free!! I\u2019m a total bookworm so this is like heaven for me lol. I really like how it saves your progress and has bookmarks to show where you left off. What would be nice though is if they could add more anime romance! I\u2019m just a sucker for romance and anime art is the best. And i would like there to be an easier way to earn coins? I can\u2019t really do a lot of challenges because I\u2019m very busy. But ya, other than that, I recommend this app. It\u2019s amazing \ud83d\ude09","923":"I really enjoy reading different genres of comics, which is why i love using webtoon. Recently, i\u2019ve been busy so i don\u2019t go on the app as much as i used to, so i guess that could be the reason why it logged me off once? no. i was about to go in and read something, when all the sudden i\u2019m sent to sign in. I already know it\u2019s not going to log me back in because i had to make another account in order to keep reading books, and i just want to know why it\u2019s always kicking me out. do i have to make multiple accounts or can you do something so i don\u2019t have to keep logging in. thank you!","924":"Webtoon is great nothing more to say. No bad things to say about it just one question. What is the new canvas mode that was included in the new update? More specifically what is it's purpose? Also there is a small issue where my screen is zoomed in and it just stays like that. I don't know if this was on purpose or a bug but would prefer if it was reverted to the original reading size that didn't cover the whole screen","925":"I enjoy Webtoon very much, and would love to create a story of my own. But every time I try to log in, it tells me my password is incorrect. I\u2019ve tried every password i have ever used. Nothing worked. Then I pressed \u2018forgot password\u2019, typed in my email, and nothing ever sends to my phone. I try refreshing, powering my phone down and trying again, and other strategies. What could be the problem? Does this also happen to others? Even with this problem, I will continue to read my favorite Webtoon stories.","926":"So I think this app is amazing and i love the stories all of them are unique and special in their own way. But lately I\u2019ve been having an issue with comments like I can\u2019t make any. I don\u2019t always have something to say about the chapters but when I do I like to able to share it. So what happens is I\u2019ll type it out and then I go to post it and it won\u2019t work it\u2019ll tell me I don\u2019t have internet and to check my wifi. But I DO have internet you can\u2019t use this app without it. So yeah if this little glitch could be fixed that would be much appreciated.","927":"I love this app it\u2019s really fun and I love all the stories but the new policy about NSFW content really doesn\u2019t make sense to me cause it makes it seem like webtoon is not a free platform for people to be creative. I think the situation should be handled better instead of just not allowing NSFW content all together. Maybe a warning or age limit that shows its 18+. This is really the only reason why I gave it three stars. The policy makes it seem like creators can\u2019t show work that they spend their time on and I understand it can be disturbing for some people but it\u2019s not fair for the creators and some readers.","928":"I absolutely love webtoon. I loved going to completed webtoons and binge-reading my personal favorites but I\u2019m not a big fan of how daily pass has become a thing bc it\u2019s taken the joy out of reading my favorite completed webtoons. If possible, I think it\u2019d be great if there was some type of event or time frame where u could read any completed webtoon without daily pass, like old times. I feel like that\u2019d make all readers more happy on this app and u wouldn\u2019t have to completely get rid of daily pass","929":"I loved this app and go on it everyday. I always loved looking at comics from other creators aswell.\n\nUnfortunately they added a policy on mature content and other things that kind of spit in the mouth of independent creators on the app. \n\nThere mature content policy was updated to be more strict. The app already required censorship but now any sort of depiction or even a innuendo of sexual actions are banned. I could understand if you want to keep a clean image, but it seems that with a policy change like that, it kind of hurts creators of romantic comics and tries to water them down just for the sake of a supposed clean image.\n\nThough I would like that part of the policy to change, That\u2019s not the main  problem. \n\nAnother policy change was with its spam and advertisement which hurts creators on the website as well. Preventing them from mentioning any outside links unrelated to the comic. Even links that could help guide fans to support the comic and the creator.\n\nOverall it was a great app, but now I\u2019m reconsidering after a stunt like this.","930":"I don\u2019t read a lot of webtoons, but I used to LOVE this app! USED TO. An old favorite of mine is Hooky. I love this webtoon with my heart and soul, and I used to look to it for artistic inspiration. I read the whole thing already, so the fact that now I have to go through some daily pass garbage just to LOOK at it is ridiculous. The worst possible addition to what was originally a wonderful app, and incredibly disappointing...\n\nHonestly, I know a lot of people who used to like Webtoon, and they all share this disappointment. Please Webtoon, fix this.","931":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for a couple years now. I don\u2019t have a single bad thing to say about this app! The authors and stories are wonderful and it is amazing that they update the featured stories each week. Personally I haven\u2019t spent any money on this app and I think that is what makes it great for me, you can still read your favorite comics without having to pay. Also I love the support that WEBTOON gives to its authors. Totally recommend this to everyone.","932":"Noblesse, Orange Marmalade are only some of my favorite webtoons but now i can\u2019t even read them, and the only reason i can see is because i\u2019m broke and webtoon has become greedy. Now i\u2019m broke and sad i used to go to webtoon everyday until the update now i caneven re read webtoons i\u2019ve read tens of times before please take away daily pass at least for webtoons with a 100 pages or more or completed ones this is all i ask even though i. pretty sure no ones gonna see this please make this app the sanctuary to my deppression that it used to be","933":"I love Webtoon and reading comics on there, but ever since my phone automatically updated the app for me, the app crashes every time I try opening it :( It works just fine on my IPad, but another issue I\u2019ve faced is that I literally can\u2019t log into my account on my iPad for the life of me. I\u2019ve been trying to get in for the past two years but nothing. When I try to reset my password it\u2019s just end up saying \u201center password\u201d first?? Really? So I\u2019m stuck with having to look for all the webtoons I subscribed to again on my iPad since it\u2019s not working in my phone. I\u2019m leaving a 1 star review until I can at least open the app and get past the loading screen.","934":"I strongly believe that they should be giving out free coins especially in this pandemic like not a lot of people got money to spend I believe they should give us some starter coins or something like that like how are we supposed to know we need to pay to read a book . Like I understand that\u2019s how you keep people interested in coming back to the app but like not even a download a app and get 10 coin like y\u2019all could have done something like that. A lot of apps are doing that and I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m starting to like WEBTOON cause I have change to different apps cause WEBTOON just take to long and plus I\u2019m not really it no more","935":"Personally I really enjoy WEBTOON I actually found it through an add, and I just love pretty much any story I come across. I\u2019ve found it very useful to listen to the top lists of genres you like they very quickly lead you to great stories. I love growing my lists of stories so that when a chapter pops up I have a few to read at a time it\u2019s a great quick entertainment it doesn\u2019t take too long but can entertain your for months. Highly recommended.","936":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for four years. It\u2019s been my main comic app because it never had the dumb ticket system which prevented me from just being able to read a full, already finished comic. Now I see that they have incorporated that dumb system which seriously pisses me off because the whole reason I loved WEBTOON was because it wasn\u2019t forcing me to watch an ad or pay to read. I would have given it five stars, but this is such a big and frustrating issue I took off three. What\u2019s even more frustrating is that they won\u2019t change this because the money is too good and their users have no say so.","937":"Ok so I love this app, I came to it because of Lore Olympus but found many other things to read that have gotten me hooked. The problem is I\u2019ve done multiple challenges for free coins. The read 100 chapters and the read a new thing every day for x amount of days, both times I\u2019ve completed this and both times I was given a notice that I\u2019d get the coins once the challenge ended. Challenger ended and still no coins. Only downside I\u2019ve seen so far","938":"Update: The app gets worse everytime it updates. It slowly loads chapters. When originals update, it takes awhile before I can even read them. When I do read, some don't show up in recent.  And now I can't even get to be subscribed list. \n\nX\n\nI love this app. However, I'm a bit disappointed that my recent didn't save when I deleted the app and downloaded again. I had a few stories I was subscribed to but not caught up on so don't know where exactly I stopped.  The only reason I even deleted the app is because any time I click on a discover story link (the banners) it opens a different app. Sadly, it still happens.","939":"I literally use WEBTOON, every day! I love reading all the creative comics. My only problem is that I feel the comics kinda take really long to be free. I can\u2019t use money to buy fast passes either. I would really like it if the waiting time was way shorter. I am stuck waiting on all of my favorite comics. I am struggling a bit to find new comics that I really enjoy. I really love WEBTOON, I just wish that I didn\u2019t have to wait so long for a new episode to finally come out!","940":"I really like the comics the app puts out, it\u2019s on a good format and I can easily spend hours reading them thanks to the plentiful amount of creators, but I have more of a technical problem. \n\nWhen I get to a certain point in a comic (I\u2019d say 1\/4th way through) it stops , and I can\u2019t scroll past that part. I have to open and close the app and it will reboot, but then it will move me to the next chapter of the comic. \n\nI like this app, but having to do this every single time is really annoying","941":"So many good stories, unfortunately many are not finished so you have to wait a week for each new chapter. Some go on indefinite hiatus which is a little frustrating. And now webtoons started this thing with finished stories where you can only read one chapter a day. Let me binge read! That's all I want in life. This app has given me a new love of web comics and the never ending frustrating unsatisfaction of not being able to read stories till the end.","942":"First of all, I love this app I love reading and supports comic artists please I beg of you please keep your comics free. Other apps such as web comics make it so you have to pay for each chapter to be unlocked but your system of the fast pass is the most reasonable. The reason why I say this is because a lot of people are having to leave the apps and find different ones because they can\u2019t afford to pay for new coins and such. Your system is great and I love the app!","943":"Ok I get it, creators need money so doing the coin system will get them the money. And yes it is only a delay for another 10 or so days so if someone is not willing to pay he money it will still be available them to them, but I am just very sad. Other comic producing apps like Tapas had amazing comics but I preferred WEBTOON becuase of the easy access and the community was also very welcoming. The coin system could potentially be thier first step away from that. \nBut I love the new aesthetics in the update \u2764\ufe0f","944":"I loved WEBTOON. I used to read it everyday. But since the policy was implemented every thing has gone downhill. It is not just the complete removal of NSFW content this app now has an allowance for pop up adds. The lack of adds was one of the reasons I loved WEBTOON in the first place. Also more than half of my favorite creators have decided to discontinue their webtoons and move to a lesser platform. Not all of them had NSFW content. They, like myself, just didn\u2019t want to have to tiptoe around and worry if their work would be reported if someone felt it inappropriate. I have seen many similar reviews like this one but WEBTOON has not responded at all. They offer no solution or compromise and that just makes me sad.","945":"WEBTOON is the BEST!!!! I love it so much!! Thrilling story\u2019s with great plot that get you hooked on the first episode!! And stunning art!!! I tried to find other sights to watch more comics but you had to pay. On WEBTOON it is absolutely free!!! And if you want to post your own comic you are free to do so!! And you can get a pretty penny out of it too. WEBTOON is also inclusive my having raffles and contest with amazing prizes!!! Highly suggest for any anime\/comic\/art lover !! I LOVE THIS SITE!!!!!!!!! Please check it out! You won\u2019t regret it\ud83d\ude09","946":"I seriously love Webtoons so much. I remember downloading the app back in late 2016 as a way to kill during\/between classes and didn\u2019t think I would love it so much now LOL. It has great stories and even if there is not as much content in the English version as in the original app (which I hate only cuz the other series look so cute) \n\nBut ANYWAYS. I love the stories the app has. Most artists\/writers update regularly which is great. And... it\u2019s FREE!!!!!!!! This app is so worth it. Download it now!!!!","947":"You know if you have a great story and nice character design you are most likely going to succeed in this app. Though most of the webcomics aren't that good it's not the websites fault. Some webcomics look amazing but have a very dull or overused plot *cough* *cough* UNordinary *cough*. I don't mean to hate on UNordinary too much it is a beautiful webcomic and being a webcomic author is not at all easy. If you have a boring life and do nothing all day why not consider become a webcomic author and having no social life or free time. Great app.","948":"I love this app so much It has helped me not be as lonely but then I read them and feel single af. But when I can\u2019t stand to wait 30 days I would like to buy some coins but I kept pressing them trying to make my mind for 5$ one or a 1$. But for some reason I was hitting  the 1$ one to much or something and it would load. So when I hit the 5$ one it loaded almost instantly. So I have no idea if it\u2019s a scam or just a little problem? But that has not stopped me from reading there just to dang good!","949":"I love this app!!it is very inspiring and I wish I could publish my own webtoons too!!just like my favourite authors!! But I cannot sadly because I don\u2019t have a pc..is it possible for you to allow us to publish WEBTOONs from our phones? There are plenty of mobile apps to create web comics!! Like medibang paint and ibs paint x and many others! It won\u2019t just do me a favor but it will do every one a favor who are going through the same thing as I am..thank you for your time\ud83d\udc9a","950":"I\u2019ve had webtoon for years, I\u2019ve read some of the more lengthy and popular series over and over again, when fast pass was first introduced I realized liked the idea and I spent easily over $100 buying coins to unlock chapters of my favorite series\u2019s. Webtoon\u2019s new function of daily pass is what made this all go from 5 starts to 2 starts in my eyes. Having access to only two chapters a day for series\u2019s with over 200+ chapters, and having to pay to unlock the rest of them with only two weeks to read it is just so stupid. Who wants to spend $40 to reread a series again? it just makes no sense.","951":"I honestly love webtoon and what it provides, as I started on the online version. I recently got the app and I have to say it\u2019s really disappointing. I couldn\u2019t even read any comics for two days because they just wouldn\u2019t load! If miraculously I find a window where any episodes actually appear on the screen, I spend minutes waiting for each page to load and it\u2019s so frustrating. Please try to keep the app at the same speed as online and be able to genuinely read a comic. I just might switch back if this continues.","952":"I have had issues with the app freezing for about a week, I\u2019ve had to resend a report with what\u2019s wrong twice and I only get automatic responses that say don\u2019t reply that also say \u201cclear cache\u201d or \u201cuninstall and reinstall\u201d or \u201ccheck WiFi\u201d I\u2019ve done all of those and more trying to get it to stop freezing and still the only way I can get into WEBTOON is using the website which is annoying. I love WEBTOON stories but I will delete the app and stop using the website if this doesn\u2019t get fixed.","953":"So I freaking love this app but recently it\u2019s gotten annoying. Fast passes are kinda annoying... but I can tolerate them they don\u2019t effect me directly I can just ignore them. I\u2019m not required to buy them they are just helpful thing for if you wanna get a in progress story faster. Ok cool whatever I\u2019m ok with waiting.... but today I open the app and go to reread some of my fav chapters from a long finished story and I can\u2019t. They added a new system where you need to pay to read story already on the app. That\u2019s just dumb and I\u2019m kinda mad about it but nbd","954":"So on September 30 a new update was made to the app, and I have to say I\u2019m really let down. This app has been wonderful and while I understand that money makes the world-go-round, it\u2019s really disappointing to know that after you\u2019ve waited diligently every week for a new release on your favorite comics; and now you want to re-read them, you have to put in money or now wait for a daily pass every 24 hours to read 1 chapter. I love to read and this app was amazing, but now it\u2019s starting to turn into a money guzzling monster. It\u2019s so hard for me to want to support something that\u2019s robbing a joy from someone.","955":"For some reason Webtoon made me start all over again? I got a new phone but remembered my account that should have everything saved, but when I logged in I had my favorites saved but it doesn\u2019t show me which chapters I finished. Your girl got a bad memory so I don\u2019t want to flip through hundreds of chapters to see where I left off. I\u2019m only giving this 5 stars because Webtoon usually just responds to their best reviews.","956":"Whenever I scroll through the pages of a comic, it somehow freezes at one point and just won\u2019t move. My entire phone starts to lag a bit so I tap out of webtoon and tap back in to see the freezed screen still there. Couple of seconds later it then unfreezes itself and goes back to the homepage. Originally I had this issue a while back, but it disappeared. Now it came back even more severe and I can\u2019t get through a single comic without it freezing. Please fix this issue.","957":"I\u2019ve been on webtoon for about 7 months now and my favorite comic by far is I love yoo. There is not much I don\u2019t like about webtoon, I saw another review and they were complaining about how some of the comics are 18+. One, 18+ comics are kinda hard to find unless you type in key words like \u201chentai\u201d or \u201cmature\u201d but even if you do click on an 18+ by accident it will usually give you a warning and 18+ or mature is usually somewhere in the title. That\u2019s all I have to say and I love yoo all sooooo much!","958":"This app is really great and I love it a lot! The only problem is that I get waaaaayyy too into it... \ud83d\ude05 this app is great and has a ton of fun comics to read I seriously recommend it. Just watch what you read because some of it is not for the ages 9+. It\u2019ll ask if ur old enough but all you have to do is tap yes which can be pretty bad if a 9 year old kid or younger person got this app. If you love fun stories, some great art, and something totally new, then get this app though.","959":"Please oh please rid of fast passes! These only make people want to delete the app as a whole! Fast passes mean waiting weeks to months to read the next episode! THATS STUPID! people should be able to read freely! If you want to keep your millions of downloads, please get rid of this new and agonizing feature! This only makes WEBTOON more boring besides the fact that we have to wait for updates! Don\u2019t get me wrong I love WEBTOON but this is BAD! Nobody wants to wait 7 days then 14 days then 21 days to read the next episode of a comic! We already have to wait for people to update.","960":"I love WEBTOON... I\u2019m practically addicted to it and I love seeing all the up and coming artists with so much talent and potential and I enjoy watching them evolve their art and storytelling styles\/ stories that are told. Unfortunately I am also an artists who has been working on a graphic novel series for some time now but I can\u2019t use this app to publish my own work because apparently you can\u2019t upload on mobile devices. This app would be great if there was a way for artists to publish their works from their phones.","961":"WEBTOON is a great app but the new policy ruins it. Most of my favorite WEBTOON creators\/artists have been discouraged by this because they won\u2019t be able to share their work on this app. The new policy limits the creative freedom and they have said that they are considering to stop posting on this app because of this new policy. Even if the NSFW is censored they are still being told to take it down. Many of my favorite BL comics were censored, but they were taken down because of this. Honestly, I might stop reading comics from this app, but please change the policy and let creators be creative with their comics so this app can be better.","962":"This app seems pretty nice and polished, but I can't sign up for an account. Terms of service and privacy policy buttons block the submit button, making it absolutely impossible for me to tap it. I can\u2019t subscribe to a comic without an account either. It would be awesome if this could be fixed?? I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just for the ipad version either, since that\u2019s what I\u2019m using. And yes before someone asks, I have tried refreshing the application. Multiple times.","963":"Absolutely love this app. There are so many comics to choose from which are amazing. By subscribing to these comics you directly support artists fulfilling their dream which is also an added bonus to great stories. Because people directly upload their episodes you may have to wait a week until reading the next one, and they usually end on cliffhangers so expect some frustration, but the wait is worth it! Love this app!","964":"Went back to reread some favorite comics and to find that they are locked now. WEBTOON is asking it\u2019s readers to repay every time they want to read a story. This app is about sharing stories that readers should be able to enjoy at their leisure. Especially if they have already unlocked something once!  \nTrust me if I could buy books of my favorite comics to keep on my bookcase I would. I\u2019m sure many would agree. \nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. WEBTOON should let its users read completed comics without the daily pass restrictions and stop hoarding the stories.","965":"I really like this app. Webtoon is a cool platform to easily read a massive library of comics. Notifies you of comic updates and has made following comics that I already have been following a lot easier.\nDownloading is annoying since you can\u2019t do anything in the app while something is downloading and if you leave the app and come back to it the download fails. Please let us download in the background. Also please add a dark mode\nThanks","966":"I love webtoon it\u2019s so much better then the rest of the comic type apps. Plus unlike the others webtoon doesn\u2019t make you pay money for everything. The only thing it makes you pay is fast pass and that lets you get a chapter a little faster. The customer service isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s a easy to use interface so you won\u2019t have much trouble. All the comics are great and all ways enjoyable.","967":"I love this app now I read all the time I love Lumine , castle swimmers, and the four of them . There\u2019s only one thing I use a sighed out account because I am not 12 even though I read it I am not the right age I\u2019m 11 I can\u2019t wait till my birthday so I can have a account. When I can sign in I am going to comets and write all how I loved the book things I don\u2019t know what to call them but there good and subscribe to the ones I love . And I think this is a 5 star app not a 4.5","968":"This is honestly my favorite app so far, I mean, I\u2019m still young and there is other apps to browse around but I\u2019m literally addicted to WEBTOON. The stories are freaking awesome and makes you wonder what happens next. I always cry to sleep when my ship doesn\u2019t make it or when the last episode ended and I have to wait a week for a new one. If you just downloaded this app and you\u2019re under 18, I would recommend: I love yoo, cursed princess club, the kiss bet, im the grim reaper, siren\u2019s lament, age matters.","969":"I would really love to give this all a 5, however, this past month, I\u2019ve been trying to buy more coins and it would give me errors such as \u201cThis purchase has already been purchased. This will be restored for free.\u201d Or it would say that I purchased the coins but no coins would refresh in my account. In either scenario, money has already been taken out off my card, but I am without coins. Can someone tell me if I will actually ever be refunded for these never happened coins or will i ever get the coins ive already paid for??","970":"I love this app, BUT the addition of the daily pass to read completed comics is horrible! I am a devoted fast pass buyer for Lore Olympus and some of my other favs but having to pay to re-read an old favorite Webtoon is devastating. If this app becomes that much of a pay to read that daily pass is put on all finished comics (and it seems to be moving to that) I\u2019m not sure if it will be worth using anymore. I\u2019m extremely disappointed. I hope everyone who hates this new policy leaves reviews to let those behind the scenes know that this new daily pass thing isn\u2019t working.","971":"It seems they spend all their money on bright colors, because the app is broken as can be. I signed up with my email, first i didnt get a verification email, fair enough, I signed up again. I clicked the link and was logged in via safari. Tried opening the app,\u201d The email used is not registered.\u201d It was literally saved into my phone when i registered it. Tried manually typing, no luck. Tried making a new account with the same email,\u201d This email is already in use!\u201d Are you kidding me. If i could give negative stars i would, because surprise surprise there is no customer support for this korean trash app.","972":"I love this app and the comics I\u2019m addicted to! But my app isn\u2019t keeping me logged in, which I\u2019m find extremely frustrating and having to reenter my login info every time I want to read an update is frustrating the crap out of me. It\u2019s gotten to the point that my phone will \u201close internet connection\u201d right after I\u2019ve read an update and then I\u2019ll have to reenter my login to be able to see what other comics have updated as well. I hope there is an easy way to fix this!","973":"Webtoon is a great app with lots of great stories. You don\u2019t have to pay for absolutely anything and you can use google to log in, which is something the IPad version does not has. But I have one story that is NSFW and is having problems with the new policy like all other NSFW stories, which makes me angry. It\u2019s one of my favorites and seeing that I have to go somewhere else in order to enjoy it more is kinda frustrating. But aside from that, it\u2019s a great app. Just gotta fix up that policy and we\u2019ll be good.","974":"I love this app it has everything. I recommend this to everyone I know so I can fan girl about certain comics. Right now I actually wake up early in the morning just to read them. I never posted anything on discover, but I always wanted to. WEBTOON literally has everything. I personally like horror and Fantasy but you can read anything you think of. Remember to thank the authors because they try really hard to make the comics every week.","975":"I LOVE webtoons, but I recently hit the point where I'm not allowed to subscribe to any more stories, but I don't want to have to unsubscribe to any of the ones that I currently read, either. :( I read a loootttttt of these, and I think that more subscriptions would also allow us readers to be more supportive of those in the writing\/drawing community. There are so many amazing stories that I want to support and follow, but I am currently unable to do so with the restriction on the amount of subscriptions that one can have. Please allow more! Thank you. :)","976":"Let me just say that I love webtoon!!! It\u2019s great you can read things for free!!! Buttttt.... the NSFW deal is making me mad!!! You can\u2019t say that people aren\u2019t warned about this!!! And if some people don\u2019t like NSFW then they don\u2019t have to read it!!! And the Arthur\u2019s have to censor it soooo much you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on!!! I will say that yes there probably is kids on webtoon but this app is 17+!! It\u2019s made for mature audiences and If the kids don\u2019t like that they can get off webtoon... I\u2019m not saying that all kids are like that but the ones who are don\u2019t need to be on the app! All I\u2019m saying is that you should deal with the NSFW a different way before I just stop using webtoon!! Because besides that issue this app is great!!!","977":"I have never enjoyed comics until I saw an ad on Facebook for Ms. Abbot and the Doctor \u2764\ufe0f. I am so glad that I downloaded this app because now I have amazing reads to look forward to on Mondays, Thursday\u2019s, Friday\u2019s, Saturday\u2019s, AND Sunday\u2019s. I have never seen so much dedication and beautiful, raw artwork until I downloaded this app. It is very easy to navigate and is so full of creativity and imagination, it really is just a beautiful app. And I\u2019m not exaggerating about this. This is BY FAR my favorite app in the App Store.","978":"Webtoons used to have a convenient tap-to-scroll function. The last update clearly removed that feature. I\u2019m giving this a 3 star rating because the app itself is nice but removing a feature is not an update, it is a downgrade. By the way, I am rating the app\u2019s functionality, not the authors. The app serves its purpose well but taking away something that was not a problem is a non-ideal move. Unless there was legitimate hate towards that function, there should be no reason to get rid of a feature that was unique to the Webtoons app. Bring it back.","979":"I love love love webtoon, so much, but since the last update it keeps saying that my account is active on another device, but it isn\u2019t. The device that it gives me the option to deregister is literally the device I\u2019m using. It\u2019s frustrating and I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s gonna end up locking me out since you can only deregister a certain number of times. I hope this gets fixed. Especially since I\u2019m on track to get the free coins for the First Night With the Duke event (I\u2019m worried this might end up causing me to not be able to make it since it won\u2019t allow me to collect today\u2019s stamp due to the device issue).","980":"Everything else is practically perfect except for this. I have cracked my screen so many times, that I cannot tap on anything on the top of my phone, so I have to exit the app when I want to switch stories and I can\u2019t search for anything, which is really annoying. I was wondering if in the next update, that you could make the app able to flip so that (people in this dire situation) can read properly and be able to search?","981":"i was currently reading a webtoon called Love Doesn\u2019t Talk, and after a couple of reading i got the daily pass thing. I thought, oh weird, but at least ALL of the episodes will be free for 14 days.\nnope.\nwhat the hell? now i have to wait a whole day to read another??? i\u2019m sorry but could you please remove this daily pass thing. it\u2019s super frustrating and not something i would get warmed up to. i wanna read completed series freely and not have to wait longer than needed to finish it.","982":"I\u2019ve been reading some stories in this app for a while and I check up weekly. However it\u2019s such a pain just to be able to log onto my account. I can log in on a web browser but the app constantly says my account doesn\u2019t exist . Whether I change the password or not. The first time I made an account it took several tries just to login after making an account and now that I\u2019ve had one on this new phone I can\u2019t log in . I can still read the stories but I lost others I was interested in.","983":"I love this app don't I haven't gone any prob,elms yet whips app I love it so much I have read like 40 to 30 books and I absolutely love the books one made me cry that a book that made cry I recommended its call ackard Magic it's so sad and happy at the same time plis read it I recommended do bad but the thing  I hate its that some people are hating on gays books  and I am waiting for all my books to get a uptade I love the feelings and the drawings plis give this app 5 stars <3","984":"This app is great! Love all the stories on here and easy to access, but there\u2019s one small problem. You get to watch add before reading an unreleased chapter but today it wasn\u2019t working for me. I kept on restarting my phone tried it on my iPad too and it wouldn\u2019t work. I closed out of the app (all the way) and it still wouldn\u2019t work. It told me to reset the Advertising Identifier. Which I did all day. And it still wouldn\u2019t let me read. Tried on multiple stories too. Same problem.","985":"Basically I\u2019ve been using it for a while now and other apps have fixed and tweaked to make reading a lot of chapters at once easier, it\u2019s why I prefer to read on tapas instead of webtoon only for the better ui and laxer censors. I can take the censors but could we have better reading ui. Like swipe to go to the next chapter or tap to the next chapter. Either is fine I just think it\u2019s easier than tap on the web toon then tap the arrow or swipe all the way down...like farther than all the way down","986":"I like the app, but every now and then it\u2019ll crash and I can\u2019t reopen it for a day or two. This is displeasing as I have to resort to going on browser to look at the webtoons. Take this review with a grain of salt though, as it may just be a problem with my phone, though I\u2019d like to let others know if they experience this problem that other people are having it too. As such, I\u2019ll still give it a high rating, because the webtoons are very high quality and the app\u2019s design is easy to use.","987":"Webtoon is an amazing app, but they recently added ads to some stories. Small ads, about 15 seconds long, and I didn\u2019t mind them. Now, however, the ads won\u2019t play and therefore I, and many others, are unable to continue reading our favorite stories. People say to just update the app, but there is no update at this moment. There is nothing to do to fix this. It\u2019s very annoying. This one small detail has ruined this amazing app.","988":"Since yesterday every time i want to read a comic or search for one, it get\u2019s lagged and the app closes. As this kept happening today i decided to delete the app (big mistake) and it got WORSE as it shows the home page as if my account was new, but i\u2019ve been using the platform for 3 years now. The problem is that this just happens on the app in my phone, and i proved it logging in my account in my laptop and it worked perfectly. I hope u read my message, thanks.","989":"If you get this app, I\u2019m 99.9% sure you are going to love it! The Webtoon called Castle Swimmer is amazing, it is about a young boy called \u2018The Beacon\u2019 but his real name is Kappa, is destined by God to fulfill every sea creatures prophecies, mostly mermaids, and mermen, he grows up and he has caught onto a prophecy for the shark people. But they know their own prophecy and capture him, their prince Siren has to kill Kappa, but he falls in love with kappa and he tries to make an escape for him. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell you, you can read the rest!","990":"I absolutely love this app, there\u2019s so many great things to read on here and I get lost within every story but lately I\u2019ve had a problem with the app. I created my account and I never logged out, but lately I\u2019ve been having to log back in and it says my email isn\u2019t registered. I have to keep re-registering it and it still happens. I hope there\u2019s a way that this problem can be solved and I hope others aren\u2019t going through the same thing as me.","991":"I love WEBTOON! It has many different stories and types of stories. It is the second most used app on my phone! I truly enjoy reading these! The stories are very thrilling! The only problem I\u2019ve had is that the app logged me out of my account and I can\u2019t get back in. Also there are these coins so you can fast pass and look at webtoon episodes soon to come in that story but there is no way to earn them. You can only purchase them at the store on the app.\nOver all I recommend this game!! It\u2019s awesome!","992":"So, I loved this app. At one point in my life. I was reading my comics peacefully, until one day they cut me off, even though I\u2019ve read further episodes, TO PAY FOR EPISODES I ALREADY READ. So I lost my track and it won\u2019t let me read past the episodes I\u2019ve already read??? It put me back about 5 episodes. And now I have to wait until the episodes I ALREADY READ BY THE WAY, come out every other week. This is just sad. I\u2019ve tried finding a way to contact WEBTOON but it just keeps bringing me back to the FAQs page and none of those answers, solve my problem. So I\u2019m just supposed to sit back and wait? Is no one going to help me solve this issue??","993":"my main problem with this app is that i lost my progress after i had to delete the app for storage space. once i reinstalled, my history disappeared and now i have to find where i last left off from all the webtoons i was reading (and i read a LOT, so it\u2019s gonna take a while) :~( love the content and community on this app tho! all creators are amazing and bring a variety of great stories to the table, and i enjoy going through the discover page to look for new series :D","994":"The new policy that you guys have added to limit certain aspects of my favorite web toon comics like (Eyes on me) has become a problem I love the webtoons app but if all my favorite comics stop posting there comics on here because of the new policy that limits mature postings  it will make my experience on this app less enjoyable I ask that you remove this policy and change it back to the way it was before where they could post such things as long as it was censored to some extent I hope that you consider my opinion thanks you for your time","995":"So I have had this app for a few years now and I absolutely love it. The stories are great the animation is beautiful. However, lately the app has been crashing on me while I\u2019m reading some of my favorite stories. I\u2019ve tried everything I can to make it stop but for what ever reason it won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a problem with my phone or the app but it\u2019s getting very annoying. Again I adore this app and everything about it I just wish it would stop crashing on me.","996":"I loving using this app and how you can use the fast pass. I accidentally screenshotted a part on the fast pass didn\u2019t mean to I already deleted the screenshot it was just of the a scene and I had forgotten I was on fast pass cause I was amazed by the art so I don\u2019t know what to do now though.\nI was going to try to email WEBTOON and let them know that it was a mistake but I could find where to do it. (Don\u2019t wanna get sued for it :( )","997":"I really enjoyed the app reading at work. I\u2019ve been using it for about 3 months I would take. Recently like last week I bought coins to catch up on my series I\u2019ve been reading. Today at work I get logged out of my account then I log back in all my series I was subscribed to were gone but showed I\u2019ve read them. My coins were all gone and I put in a support ticket but from the reviews I read on here, I\u2019m out of luck on my money. I spent money thinking this was a good app. Now I just recommend you never buy anything from this app, just use it as a free version app.","998":"Haii I\u2019m just here to tell everybody that because Wattpad was bought by Webtoon the are banning a lot of stuff for example on of my favorite authors has had many accomplishments in her writing and then recently she had over 7 books then all of a sudden they are gone it took her so long to write these. Now from what she has said she did not get any warning in advance so she had no time to save her work and most of her stories are deleted. She is now hoping that some of her readers have them backed up so she can find a way to continue her work. Thank you for you time, sorry to be a bother but I had to get this out. Again thank you","999":"I do love this app an there are a lot of great comics on this but I don\u2019t like the daily pass option, I\u2019m sure if you want to support the authors you can set up a donation page or instead of 1 episode per day I would think 3-4 per day would be better. (Another thing is how it\u2019s only available for 14 days) I don\u2019t like how when a series is completed you add a daily pass on it, it gets frustrating having to wait a day every time even if the series is already completed. I don\u2019t think people can afford to keep purchasing coins.","1000":"Lovely app with loads of stories for any type of person, would rate 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for the video ads. They are on a lot of the canvas stories and I don\u2019t have any problem with watching them to support creators but the problem is I never can. When I try to play them it hardly ever works and tells me to try again later. I have noticed that many others also have this happen from the comments. Once again, other than that it\u2019s a great app.","1001":"App works well and has great content but the pricing for completed works makes no sense. Even if I spent $30 I wouldn\u2019t be able to read a complete series vs Shonen Jump which costs $2 a month and gives me access to all new and historical content. Most of the completed series are available online on other sites, it would be better to be able to buy a series outright at a discounted price or have a monthly subscription. This model pushes people off the platform and means the artist gets even less in the long term.","1002":"I usually don\u2019t write reviews for apps but this app deserves one I love the way that there are events so there is a way to get free coins unlike other apps and the stories and authors are amazing and there are warnings on some stories for children who use the app like say a child wanted to read a story but it isn\u2019t for there age there is a warning for 18+ which I have noticed on some other apps they don\u2019t do that so yeah great app would definitely suggest it","1003":"I used to love webtoon a lot compared to different comic apps because we didn\u2019t have to pay to read everything. Webtoon was great as I could binge read a comic and I loved it so much. Now all of a sudden there\u2019s a new update where we only get to read 6 episodes every 14 days and I think it\u2019s the dumbest thing ever.  There\u2019s great stories and it\u2019s what makes me stay on this app but having to wait to read more episodes because our daily limit is due is annoying because I end up forgetting most of what happened in the episodes before.","1004":"Ok so I love WEBTOON so so so very much but... I really hate the whole fast pass thing or the waiting a couple days thing it\u2019s really annoying cuz I really wanna be able to read my favorite comic but I can\u2019t and once again I love ur app so so very much and I just wanna know if u could maybe make the use of the coins for something else and just make the episodes be able to be viewed whenever without waiting. You don\u2019t have to do any of this! I love ur app!","1005":"I have had WEBTOON for years and have been absolutely addicted to the quality content just filling it. However I\u2019m afraid I cannot recommend this in its current form specifically due to one aspect. They have put daily limits on reading finished works, while I\u2019m not against paying for early peaks of currently running works to go back to finished works that many people have read or were reading already is just move for greeds sake. I know similar apps have harsher or similar monetization but based on how webtoons has built its audience and advertised itself it just leaves a bad taste. The other apps are now more worth while with more reasonable subscription options.","1006":"This is the best app on my phone! It makes making up so much nicer! I used to hate Mondays and Tuesdays, but now I wake up on Tuesday and immediately think \"hey purple hyacinth is updated today!\" the stories and art are amazing and if you really can't wait a week for the next episode you can use fast pass. Normally it costs money but there are usually challenges where you can earn free coins. You should definitely get this app!!","1007":"I\u2019ve had this app for a long time and I absolutely love the comics! It\u2019s super time consuming and addicting and inspires me to draw sometimes! But some things need to be fixed \nHear me out, \nThe daily pass is super annoying..I want to reread some of the old completed comics and I have to do a daily pass for something that I already read..I know what happened.. it\u2019s quite irritating \nOne more thing, I feel like this should be 13 or 14 age recommend..like I said love the comics! But when I got this (I was 12) I really wish I could have been a little more prepared for some of the content..I\u2019m REALLY happy that it\u2019s not 17+ like most comic apps \ud83d\ude02 but I feel like 12 isn\u2019t old enough\nOverall it\u2019s a great app! Not perfect but I mean-nothing is \ud83d\udc95\nA developer\u2019s response would be awesome","1008":"WEBTOON is my favorite app for reading comics and such, and usually I don\u2019t have problems with it. But this morning after u woke up and went to go see which WEBTOONs were updated, the app kept crashing the second I opened it, I\u2019ve tried powering my phone off and on, I\u2019ve tried deleting the app and redownloading it 3 times now, I\u2019ve cleared the cache too. The app still continues to crash the second I open it, it would be really nice if someone could help me stop the crashing so I can continue reading my WEBTOONs.","1009":"The comics featured inside the app are very enjoyable to read, with quite a good quality in each i\u2019ve read and some with tiny bits of animation. Along with this is an easy to use way of reading said comics, with only swipes of your finger. However, a large glaring problem that i have been having is frequent freezing and crashing. When you begin to read a comic, it has the opportunity to freeze and crash the app, making you wait to continue reading it.","1010":"I\u2019ve been reading on WEBTOON for a long time, but today the app automatically updated by its self and now it won\u2019t work. Every time I try to click on a comic to read it wouldn\u2019t load and eventually, the app would close itself. On my sisters phone it works perfectly fine, but for some reason on mine it doesn\u2019t. I even updated my phone, uninstalled the app and downloaded it again, but nothing changed and the app still wouldn\u2019t work, and this even deleted all my progress of the webtoons I recently read. Please fix this. This is a great app otherwise, and I would really want to start reading again if you could fix this issue.","1011":"i like this app a lot, it\u2019s really great. but recently i\u2019ve noticed that on the older webtoons, most of the series that are completed, you can only read two a day or you have to pay to keep reading, which is absolutely ridiculous. i understand the new fast pass, i think it\u2019s actually a great idea, it gives creators a way to make more money and not have to rely on their patrons. but these creators have already done their comic and are now, more than likely, creating a new one. i was reading Girls of the Wild\u2019s, i have been for a while, and now i can\u2019t read more than two a day and it upsets me","1012":"I think Webtoon is probably the best comic reading app I\u2019ve ever purchased. Not only it\u2019s free to read ALL stories, you can comment and give feedback. The thing I like about this app the most is that you don\u2019t have to be bombarded with \u201c 7 days free trail to read next chapter\u201d. I\u2019ve had this app for almost 7 months and I really love it. I recommend this app to anyone who loves to read comics. ALSO if your new, I recommend Lore Olympus if your a Greek Mythology\/ Romance fan!! Happy reading :)","1013":"Brought a whole new spectrum to what I can see from people it truly showed what some can bring when given time to explore there imagination from the thrilling fights from god of high school and tower of god to the beautiful setting and story of helios familia as well as funny  moments as well this is truly a good app even though it seems simple I can safely say that this was time well spent getting this app I would give a perfect ten rid the rate could go higher","1014":"I didn\u2019t really have high hopes for it but I\u2019ve come to love it more and more. It has a wide array of comics, user friendly interface, ad free and about as close to perfectly made as I\u2019ve seen an app come. And not only is the app great, but the community is overall full of awesome people that appreciate all the art and authors that come with it. I will never get rid of this app. Try it if you\u2019re on the fence. I certainly didn\u2019t regret it.","1015":"I love, LOVE, LOOOVE this app!! There are comics that cater to every age, and they\u2019re all free! There are the occasional adds\/pop-ups, but they go away simply with a swipe. \n\nEvery morning I read my subscribed stories, I have at least 3 update everyday, and I get updates to tell me which ones update. There are stories on the Featured label that update on a fixed schedule and those on Discover that update whenever they can. I love them all!! \n\nThis app is 120% recommended!!!","1016":"I really love webtoon. All the stories on there are so amazing. I just don\u2019t like the daily pass thing or the \u201c1 free ep. every day\u201d thing that\u2019s added onto the completed webtoons because sometimes I might wanna go back and read it again. This also goes for the webtoons I haven\u2019t read yet that I wanna read but can\u2019t. Overall, I really love this app but I really want the daily pass and 1 free ep. every day to be removed.","1017":"There is no possible way to describe how much this app means to me I love so so so so so so so much and honestly to keep it simple it has the best stories (my personal favorites being \u201cUnordinary\u201d and \u201cSub Zero\u201d) this app is truly the best and it is so amazing. Sadly it dose take time for some of the \u201cepisodes\u201d to come out but it is so worth the wait and luckily you don\u2019t only have one or two stories you have hundreds this is the best app ever and I just love it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","1018":"I\u2019m so happy my friend told me to download this. I love reading these comics and some of the artwork is stunning. I\u2019m currently working on my own comic for the new contest, and I hope to win one of the prizes! I really appreciate how much effort the creators put in to their stories, I didn\u2019t realize how hard it is until I started making my own. They\u2019re so creative and fun and make me smile every day. Thank you to the creators of comics and the creators of Webtoon!","1019":"I absolutely loved this app and have had it for 2 years now. But recently, I haven\u2019t been able to get on bc it kicked me out of my account. I was finally able to get back on to see that all my webtoons had been unsubscribed\ud83d\ude21. A handful of them were in my recents, so I was able to subscribe to those. But, more than half of the webtoons I have read are not in my recents and I have lost them. I know what they are but can\u2019t remember the names so now most of my webtoons are gone and I don\u2019t know how to find the ones I have read already. It also got rid of all my coins that I had. I\u2019m rlly disappointed bc I loved this app but I don\u2019t know if I will ever use it again.","1020":"I\u2019ve been using Webtoon for a while now. I love it. However every time there is an update or something is changed on the app I am logged out (with none of my emails working) and un-subscribed from everything I was reading. I then have to go back and refind all my comics and sometimes I can\u2019t because they are not featured or original, it\u2019s part of canvas. I hope this stops happening because not only do I lose my place, I also lose some comics that I love.","1021":"Ok, I\u2019m going to start by saying I absolutely Love Webtoon. It\u2019s a fantastic app and I go on it everyday to read all my favorite comics. There is only one flaw to this app. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m rating this app 4 stars. The only flaw is fastpass. I can\u2019t stress the fact how much I hate fastpass. It drives me insane having to wait usually a week to read the next episode and I can\u2019t handle it. I know that buying coins and stuff is a way for them to make money but I seriously hate it and I wish I didn\u2019t have to wait for the next episode.","1022":"I\u2019ve had this app for years. I love all the series and I liked the fast pass idea. It\u2019s a great way for authors to make money and readers to get ahead on their current, uncompleted series. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why they had to bring it so far as to introduce daily passes? If they don\u2019t stop here it will get to the point where we\u2019ll have to pay for everything. I used to enjoy binging new series but it\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m just going to go somewhere else for comics if it gets worse.\n\nWebtoon. Please don\u2019t let it get worse.","1023":"I love the app.... but a couple months ago I updated the app, and now I have to wait like two weeks to read an episode.... or you can use 5 coins to read them. Problem is, I don\u2019t know how to earn coins. They don\u2019t tell you how to earn them. When I try to click the next episodes to see if it\u2019ll say something about how to earn coins it just says we\u2019re experiencing server issues. I updated the app recently and it still says the same thing. I love the app but I\u2019m getting annoyed with it. I\u2019m close to the point of deleting it.","1024":"I absolutely love Webtoon. I could (and sometimes do) read it all day. the stories are so well written and peak my interest from the very start, and let\u2019s not forget about the artistic talent. anyways if you\u2019re thinking about getting this app i definitely agree with you. if you want story suggestions i 100% recommend the story \u201ci love yoo.\u201d i literally go crazy with excitement when i hear or see anything remotely related to it, THAT\u2019S how good it is #notsponsored","1025":"I love this app and I have had it ever since it came out!\nThe one thing it might need a little fix on is that the app keeps on freezing...I keep on having to turn off my phone then start reading again..it happens every few minutes but then, once again I cannot stop reading...I might stop reading the comics if it keeps happening because it is extremely annoying though...\nThank You! \n...(hopefully developers will fix it soon!)","1026":"I love this app and all the great Webtoons available on it, but recently I\u2019ve been having trouble playing my music while reading, I think it might be because of the video ads(?) or something else. Like the song I was playing would stop whenever I scroll down or click on a webtoon. Before I was able to listen to music with no problem, however that is an issue for me now. PLEASE fix this and thank you.","1027":"I love this app!!! It\u2019s so enjoyable to read the amazing stories that people come up with and to see the incredible art. The only thing that is sad is the coin system. I understand you need to make money oof of this but some people can\u2019t spend their money on this, maybe make a way to earn coins without paying actual money. You could have if you watch a video you get 10 coins or something. Other than that I love this app and totally recommend it!","1028":"Webtoon is one of my favorite apps to just relax and read comics, it really is great because it\u2019s free and you don\u2019t have to worry about spending any money. \nThe new policy however, is restricting any sort of 18+ content which has caused many creators to end their comics which is far from fair because most of the time, these authors are making money and putting majority of their time into this app. \nI hope this is to be fixed in the future, otherwise it may lead to a decline in Webtoon usage. \nThanks~!","1029":"Hello. I love Webtoon and all the lovely comics but the new policy about erasing all nsfw when it\u2019s all CENSORED does not make sense to me. There are even warnings before the smut scenes so if it makes people uncomfortable, then they are allowed to SKIP it. Don\u2019t make authors erase parts and come up with a fixed plot because they can add that in anymore. It\u2019s censored and haters can just turn blind eyed to it. Let the authors write their stories and let the people that love it, read it. Thank you. Have a good day.","1030":"This app is simply amazing. What a cool concept that anyone can make and share comics and get rewarded if it has public appeal! Not to mention that it\u2019s free and all payments are voluntary donations. However, some of the stuff that gets featured by the editors of the site can be pretty terrible. Usually the truly good stuff doesn\u2019t get featured on the main site (like Lailin\u2019s Curse or Jackson\u2019s Diary) and the trashy ones do (like all the cringy\/cliche romances). Still though, it\u2019s a very cool app if you know how to find what suites you best.","1031":"It\u2019s amazing but why can\u2019t we just watch 3 ads and then we are able to read the next episode. Like I don\u2019t want to pay coins because I really can\u2019t afford it and to help you guys get money, we don\u2019t we just watch ads for the people who can\u2019t buy coins? Like coins should still be available to others if they would like to, but for the people who can\u2019t afford the coins we should get the option to watch an ad.","1032":"No doubt, I\u2019d rate it 5 stars. Since I love anime, having webtoon, gives new flavor. Its colored, it has music. The authors are so great with their stories\/plots. It\u2019s cool to see as well how the authors develop their art style thru time. Also, having the comment part, makes it more enjoyable since you know there are other people whom you can relate to. Everybody gives their theories, opinions etc. This app kinda gives you an opportunity to be creative and explore ideas!","1033":"So I\u2019ve had this app for at least a year. Just recently people have started commenting inappropriate sites. My little sister uses this app too and I don\u2019t want her to accidentally go to these sites. But don\u2019t get me wrong I absolutely love the app itself and don\u2019t plan on deleting it any time soon. I just ask everyone that has it or plan on getting it to take caution and don\u2019t search anything people comment. Trust me, I made the mistake myself.","1034":"Webtoon is a great app. Everything is free you do not need to pay for anything to read except pf course fast pass. The only thing I do not like about Webtoon is how you would pay for fast pass and get to read them but you would still have to wait for much longer days\/weeks\/months to read the next episodes, though I do understand the situation with the on going episodes. Of course they\u2019re still doing it, but completed series shouldn\u2019t be like thag :\/","1035":"I\u2019m okay with the whole Ad reward thing for canvas but sometimes the ad doesn\u2019t work. Like I\u2019ll try to watch an ad and it says unable to load reward ad please try again later. I\u2019ll switch to data or WiFi and nothing. I tried to get the episode again and it\u2019s been 3 days. I still can\u2019t load the ad. I normally have to wait 2-3 days in order for the ad to work. That shouldn\u2019t be the case. If webtoon is able to fix this issue then the app is perfect.","1036":"The stories are amazingly good. People who are getting mad over daily pass need to chill. The company needs to make money to pay the employees and the writers, you typing stuff like that, makes the author feel bad. They work so hard each and every day to get these comics out, something you don\u2019t understand. So stop getting so petty, small-minded and immature over daily passes. People like you are what is annoying to society.","1037":"I know my review is probably insignificant but this app is the actual definition of pure happiness. Endless stories and genres and so much variety with those stories. I love how you can just start a webtoon and not be too popular but as more people read it can eventually be loved by many. Also, like, BEST WAY to pass the time. You get soooo hooked it\u2019s insane. And it\u2019s free like what I can\u2019t even believe it it\u2019s just like perfect","1038":"I really enjoy this app. I get to read so many amazing comics\/manga. The creators of the comics\/manga are great at what they do and all the comics\/manga are amazing and I love them. I really enjoy the romance, adventure, and sci-fi. I enjoy all of them but those three and a couple more are all great and I\u2019m great full for this app because when I am bored or have nothing to do I come to this amazing app called webtoon and read to my hearts content. I hope you all love this app as much as I do. \u2665\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","1039":"Hi I\u2019m Collin I Read Comics From Is WEBTOON it was fun to read and I read it 24\/7 my favorite comic (right now) is The FOUR of them \nI Also like that it\u2019s free for guests and I like that kinda thing usually apps are like \u201cPaY uS moNEy tO conTinUE tHeSe sErIEs!\u201d And I don\u2019t like that (everyone) but when this came out I was surprised this was more fun than *AHEM* TouYube so I like this app cuz kids these days like anime (and I\u2019m one of \u2018em!) and thanks for ever existing ima read more FOUR of them now!","1040":"I\u2019ve been using the app for about a year now and I absolutely adore it but lately I\u2019ve been getting ads that would randomly pop up that were highly inappropriate or strange. Sometimes there would even be different sounds from a radio playing that would casually stop my music. This could just be a virus in my phone but it only happens when I\u2019m on this app. I do recommend the app because of its amazing stories but just be cautious. Apologies if this came off rude. Good day.","1041":"I personally love webtoon because you could find different styles and genres of comics. But then the new policy happened, which caused some of the authors of my favorite webtoons to change. Episodes were taken down, storyline has been changed, scenes have been cut, and now the author has to think of something new to put out there and fast. I still love webtoon, but not really liking the changes. Maybe they could do something about the new policy, overall it\u2019s great.","1042":"I\u2019ve only had the app for about a month and I love, but there is one thing that has been a little annoying and it is that if you subbed to a comic that doesn\u2019t upload weekly, it still appears in the originals folder even if they aren\u2019t going to upload and same goes for comics that or on break. I just want their to me a setting to just hide comics that are on break or aren\u2019t uploading that week.","1043":"So when I first started using webtoon I thought it was a good app to read all my favorite daily comics. As time went on I noticed some changes with some of the authors I read. It is very frustrating when you are very deep into the story and then you see an apology for not being able to post the next panels because of the new policy. If this keeps going on I may just switch to taptastic and stop using webtoon altogether. Anyway, this was just my opinion, but I\u2019m sure I speak for a lot of people out there when I say that I just wants things to be the way they were before the policy ever took motion.","1044":"I checked the App Store reviews to see if anyone else is having issues on Webtoon, and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m not the only one. For the past few days I haven\u2019t been able to load anything other than the homepage. Same as the other recent reviews, I can\u2019t read any of my favorite webtoon comics :( My Internet is fine, and my phone never glitches, so I assume there\u2019s an issue with WebToon\u2019s servers right now. Please fix soon Webtoon, I would love to keep reading. Thank you!","1045":"I have been looking for a app where I can read good comics for a while now and I\u2019m so happy that I found this it\u2019s so convenient it\u2019s great for easy reading for so many languages. Also the art work is amazing and the amount of people and comics on this platform is incredible and I have it set so i can read a page everyday when they come out cause of how many and how many genders there are it\u2019s truly incredible so thank you Line Webtoon!","1046":"Not gonna lie this app is actually really nice, but they added this thing where you unlock a episode everyday. Which is actually really smart,but the thing is logging in is hard. I\u2019ve tried to login but every time it says it\u2019s the wrong password or the WiFi\u2019s bad or you can\u2019t do this right now try again later. Also when I did log in it never let me read the next episode the next day! There are story\u2019s I use to read that I was gonna finish that u can\u2019t anymore! If WEBTOON could fix this problem or just get rid of the daily pass thing I might be actually be able to finish reading all the amazing story\u2019s by amazing authors and artist!","1047":"On the new iPhone 12 Pro, the small bar at the top covers the top of the comic. I can pull it down to read it, but it\u2019s become pretty irritating.\nIt would be nice if WEBTOON saved what you\u2019ve read across devices. If you have more than one place you read, it\u2019s really easy to lose your place.\nLastly, I would prefer when clicking the \u201cmy\u201d tab to be taken directly to my subscriptions vs recent, personally. But as stated, that is my own preference.\nWouls give 4 stars if not for the iPhone bar getting in the way.","1048":"It\u2019s a great app I love all of the stories but why would you have stop it dead in the middle or one of the episode things like that is just some way of torture that I\u2019m never going to understand like for 45 dollars you can get what 500 coins and that\u2019s going to last you about a week or so because each episode thing cost 5 coins and depends if you read a lot of stories like my that\u2019s not going to last you like please whoever made this just let us read no having to pay or wait just let us read I mean that\u2019s what we came here for","1049":"I absolutely love WEBTOON I would read all my favorite comments and everything but it stopped working... It won\u2019t let me in the app anymore TwT... I have deleted and reinstalled the app and it still won\u2019t work... Other than the recent not working part, I would have rated 5 Stars. Is there a way to fix this? If there is then I will change my rating to 5 Stars again and continue reading the amazing comments!!!","1050":"Honestly I like WEBTOON, but these in-app purchases get in the way. I can\u2019t stay caught up to some comics. WEBTOON used to be free and now that it\u2019s not it\u2019s really taking away from the app. Also the new policy is egregious. Also the app constantly crashes as soon as I open the app, too make matters worse I have free coins on my account that will expire. I have gotten no help for this issue and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any solution that works. I can read anything on the app for any of my devices. This is a huge problem and it needs a solution.","1051":"I love webtoon, it is honestly my favorite app, and I use it everyday, but this new reward ads for canvas does not work, it will say loading ad, then it will say reward cannot be loaded, and I\u2019m not the only person that this is happening to either, I\u2019ve checked comments on different stories that have just started the ads and there are many people having this issue.\n Please fix ASAP!!!! \nI WANNA READ!!!!!!!","1052":"So I\u2019m going through and it tells me I should log in so I make my account. Then I try to login when it saves on my iPad the password and says incorrect so I reset my password and make a new one.i log in and says incorrect and makes me do this weird letter thing which was hard to read and you can only change the color of it instead of changing it to another one.I will try again more and more and I\u2019ve now reset my password 4 times now and each time using a different password even putting it in by hand sometimes but still doesn\u2019t work don\u2019t know if multiple people have had this issue but I know I have.","1053":"Though this app is great it still has its flaws, such as the download bug that I have. This download bug causes me to be unable to download any of the WEBTOONs. Also whenever I try to download it just says I have unavailable storage, yet when I look in the settings it says that I have more than enough storage to download any document. Please fix this bug or tell me of a way to fix it, as I may not be the only one that is having the same issue, Thank You.","1054":"I love this so much. There are so many amazing comics from light hearted to romance even horror. The creators and artist really put their heart and soul into it. \n\nAlthough I\u2019d like to be able to categorize the comics I\u2019ve read or am reading. There should be a setting where we can add a comic to a favorites list\/folder that way we can easily access it. Or even just allow us to make our own folders so that we can organize our reads.","1055":"Every time I try to enjoy a webcomic, this ad pops up that blocks half of my screen, never goes away and I always have to reset the app to make it functional again. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it if it only happened rarely but this is something that is constant. it just ruins my immersion and enjoyment that I just don\u2019t want to continue read due to the insane amount of interruptions from those ads. Please, if anyone can get on this is fix it, I would appreciate your work and dedication. Thank you and I\u2019ll change my review the moment it\u2019s fixed cause I really do love the creators on your platform.\n\nKeep up the hard work\nSincerely \nArt.","1056":"I keep getting a STARR labs ad that covers half the screen that I can\u2019t exit out of without closing the app fully... sometimes I would just keep reading with only half the screen functional enough to read, but low and behold, the ad would duplicate and cover the bottom portion as well I\u2019m probably the not the only one with this problem but it is severely affecting my ability to read the great updates.","1057":"So I love this app so much it has so many amazing writers and I love reading all the stories. But the kinda new policy for mature content needs to go. It has ruined many of the WEBTOONs I read and I end up\ngetting very confused without the scenes,\nand basically ruins the whole thing for me. I am pretty sure younger people would know if a story seems to mature and won\u2019t click on it. So, just get rid of the policy there has been so many complaints just make everyone happy and get rid of it.","1058":"When you\u2019ve been using this app for years you start to notice when it\u2019s going downhill. First, it started with cracking down on mature content. Then with the introduction of \u201ccoins\u201d to get to read more episodes ahead of the roughly one episode per week and now\u2014 even worse- \u201cDaily Pass.\u201d\n\nDaily Pass is a feature that was wholly unnecessary and it is undoubtedly upsetting to long time readers. What it does is give you a limit on completed series which in result doesn\u2019t allow you to binge the series\u2014 unless you pay for coins.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer the app that it used to be and it feels like it is becoming another one of those Freemium apps that I don\u2019t like. Unfortunately, despite the bad reviews here and there I don\u2019t think they will remove the Daily Pass feature. \n\nIn the least, they should make it less restricting than it is. Because there are some very good Webtoons on here I won\u2019t uninstall the app, at least for now. If things continue to get worse then I might have to.","1059":"The stories on here are great! I\u2019ve never liked comics but they got me hooked. However, waiting 19 days for new episodes when they are so short is a bit annoying, by then I\u2019ve forgotten what I even liked about them. I tried creating an account (without logging in through Facebook or google) and it simply won\u2019t let me. It keeps telling me to \u201center my email\u201d although I have like 100 times and there is nothing incorrect about it. Not being able to create an account is probably enough to make me stop using soon.","1060":"Everything about this is great and very entertaining but, the do now show again button for the pop ups don\u2019t even seem to work. They show up again even after I checked it many times. And the free coins are basically useless, you I can\u2019t use them for anything. If I wanted to buy an episode and had 5 coins they would have to be purchased and not free. I didn\u2019t find anything I could even use free coins for, seems like I\u2019ve been cheated.","1061":"The app is great, and you can find many wonderful comics, but there is one thing I need to address. Unlike others, I appreciate the policy that others are complaining about. As a teenager myself, I don\u2019t want to read some rated R material accidentally. What I\u2019d like, is if each comic had a rating before you begin reading. It doesn\u2019t seem to have that, so for other teens\/kids be careful you aren\u2019t reading anything to mature for your age.","1062":"Ever since the new update, everything on the app has been okay until I read more than around 4 comics. Then, the app kicks me back to the home page and freezes for about 30 seconds, and after that the app crashes. I've tried to restart my phone but to no avail! Please look into this, as I would still like to support my favorite creators again.","1063":"This first time I got this app I loved it. I would use it for hours and hours. But when I finished one of my stories I had to wait a couple days for the next chapter or episode. Now you have to pay coins if you want to read the next chapter. I don\u2019t mind waiting but some of the time the chapter take 24 days until you can read it. But overall this is a really great app. And if anyone is reading this you should get this app.","1064":"so i personally don\u2019t like this app. it is definitely going to need some work. i also want to make something clear, what they are doing to wattpad will loose wattpad loads of money because of no smut- like uhhh? it\u2019s a 17+ rated app with mature books overall. like drugs and all of that so having no smut would make NO SENSE! that shouldn\u2019t be happening. it\u2019s a writing app and people get paid also for writing things like this, this will loose them too many writers and people who get the app. some decisions as of lately have been questionable or down right horrible. this is one of them. not a good app overall and this news isn\u2019t making it sound any better.","1065":"I\u2019ve had this problem happen before where my account got locked for some reason and WEBTOON claims I never registered with them but I still get email updates on the stories I\u2019m subscribed too. It\u2019s really frustrating to deal with again because I don\u2019t remember where I left off on most of the stories I was reading. I was able to get my account back to times it has happened but now it seems like it won\u2019t be the case this time. Just glad I didn\u2019t actually purchase anything if my account was going to get deleted out of nowhere \ud83d\ude44","1066":"I have been reading Webtoon for a couple of years now, and I love all the amazing stories it had to offer. But with daily passes for completed stories, I don\u2019t really think Webtoon was the greatest it was before. I enjoy rereading stories I have already read to remmeber the memmories of me reading it, so please remove daily pass or something about it. And Thank you for the many years before and in the future you have served as one of the best apps to read stories for free :)","1067":"The app and it vast sea of content is great... however the daily limit on some of the comics is horrible. One episode a day for a comic with over TWO HUNDRED episodes? It takes over half a year to complete one WEBTOON with this setup nevermind the fact that the comics are RELOCKED after fourteen days. The only saving grace is that they are free while they are being uploaded however if you just found a series and its gonna be stamped with the daily limit soon that forces you to either binge watch the whole thing or be forced to wait if you want more.","1068":"For some reason now whenever I tried to launch the app it starts to crash, when I restart my phone it works for another 10-15 seconds and then crashes, I downloaded the app yesterday and it worked fine for me and I really enjoyed it but now it crashes whenever I try to launch the app. I hope that the devs can find a quick fix to this because I really want to continue reading the stories and using the app.","1069":"Hi first I wanna say that I love webtoon. The comics are awesome and it\u2019s very easy to use and navigate. I was reading a comic last night and I stopped around midnight. It updated while I was asleep and now I can\u2019t open it. Webtoon crashes before I get past the logo. \n\nI turned my phone off and back on and it still isn\u2019t opening. I did a forced reset too and still- nothing.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only one having this issue or not but it\u2019s a real bummer. Please fix it!","1070":"While using the app for over three years there has been no problems until recently. The app keeps freezing and not loading the comics properly. I have tried reloading, logging in and out, and now re downloading the app. Nothing has worked. I have yet to contact them about it but will probably some time soon. Other than that. It is a wonderful app full of diverse comics and would highly recommend it to others.","1071":"I love webtoon so much! I probably read every single day. I love to suspense of waiting every week. And honestly I have nothing bad to say about it. I love manga so much and it is basically my life. I always am looking for a new webtoon to read. I think it would be nice if there was some sort of spin a wheel to get coins. I know this review is super short but I really don\u2019t have anything bad to say only good. Anyways just keep doing what you are doing webtoon!","1072":"Amino..has its goods. You meet new people, enter communities, and there's tons of things to talk about. There are so many ways to make you feel welcomed, and finaly 'meet' someone else who has the same interests in you. It can make you feel happy, of course. But sometimes, you can get too addicted. It can become a habit, and its unhealthy. I've tried to stop many times but it almost becomes impossible. I guess it isn't the worst thing? But it can become a serious problem.","1073":"So I\u2019ve had webtoon for awhile and I can\u2019t finish the last few parts of the episode because of the coins I don\u2019t want to buy cause that\u2019s dumb so webtoon can you please like do something else other than have us buy coins like I think you should have us earn the coins instead of buying them they can just earn them by reading those other episodes thanks hope you read this webtoon.","1074":"I love the app. All the webtoons are addictive and hilarious. Sucking you into the world distant from your own, but there\u2019s a issue I have with it. When I\u2019m not connected to WiFi and on LTE it sometimes won\u2019t work and the home page will say no internet connecting and each time I retry it doesn\u2019t work. Even if I do connect to my WiFi it still won\u2019t pop up. So that\u2019s my issue, but other than that this app is amazing.","1075":"I'm a big fan of webtoon but lately I haven't been able to acess even the app because whenever I get to the main menu it freezes. Keep up the good work though this app is honesty suitable for all ages and as an avid reader there is endless content to choose from ( Lumine, Noblesse, Rebirth, Suihira, Dice, Lookism, The Strange Tales of Oscar Zahn, Hive, etc). This app has been where most of my iPhones battery has been going so please fix this small glitch \ud83d\ude2d","1076":"I don\u2019t write reviews, This is the only review I ever decided to do\u2026 However this app is so good I decided to write a review . I tried out a couple comic apps, and I haven\u2019t found one as good as this. I absolutely love this app and would definitely recommend it to anyone. If you\u2019re looking to start a comic and you want people read it this is the one for you or if you\u2019re just looking to read comics like me this is also for you. Wonderful app!!!","1077":"Okay so I\u2019ve used this app for a good while now, but very recently the ads have become basically all scams and redirects. I get sent to scam sites, redirected to random apps in the appstore, and at some point I got a long message from apple asking me if I wanted to go through with some call, the message containing the word scam and whatnot. I was scared my phone was hacked or something for a day or so, until I realized this only occurred when going to the next webtoon chapter in a webcomic. Now I can\u2019t even use the app out of fear of getting scammed\/hacked. Please fix these ads, and I\u2019ll give back the 5 star rating.","1078":"I think this is some sort of bug or maybe it\u2019s just for me, but whenever I go down to the comments section of the comics if there is a Twitter Ad I automatically go to the Twitter App in my App Store. It\u2019s like I clicked on it and wanted to see it, but I actually didn\u2019t. The first time it happened I was like \u201coh that\u2019s fine I just clicked on it by accident\u201d... but now it\u2019s been many times this has happened\ud83d\ude10","1079":"the daily pass feature on webtoon not only doesn\u2019t work half the time, but will create problems with saving where you left off in the book, which is annoying as a one time occurrence, but infuriating when it happens daily.  half the time i\u2019m not even able to finish the daily pass stories, which is disappointing to me and unfair to the artist themselves.  Why spend so much work on a story that\u2019s not even available to be read.  i have been reading webtoon for 5 years and i had absolutely no problems with it until the daily pass feature appeared.","1080":"I love this app and have used it for such a long time, but all of a sudden now it doesn\u2019t load properly. If I try to tap a button it won\u2019t work and is quite annoying. I am devastated because I love comics and manga and this is the best app for those, but now I can\u2019t use it! Please try to fix this problem for me (and others who might have the issue too) because my other apps are working perfectly fine, and I am missing out on new updates!","1081":"I feel like webtoon should have a place where you can see ALL the series you subscribed to that updated on that certain day I understand that there\u2019s already a thing like that on the home page but I\u2019m subscribed to so many I can\u2019t even see all of them that updated that day so I miss out on some webtoons! I think it would be a good idea for something like that :)","1082":"There was a great time in this app\u2019s history when there was plenty of awesome content for free. Then they added ads and pop ups, that was fine. Then they added pay to skip ahead, and that was fine. But now they\u2019ve made it so you can only read 1 a day and this is no longer okay. I like to read comics all at once so it is incredibly frustrating to try to read a comic with several hundred episodes one day at a time. I\u2019m always in fear now that the comic I\u2019m about to start reading will go on daily pass without notice and I won\u2019t be able to read. Such a corporate disappointment.","1083":"I loved webtoon until the recent added Daily Pass BS. I would honestly rather buy a physical copy of the story than buy coins just to read the story in a couple of sittings rather than a short chapter every day.\nLike webtoon knows what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s dirty. Seriously if you\u2019re going to make me unlock a chapter a day at least let it stay available to me for more than 14 days? I\u2019d love in support these creators but not like this. Now adding an option to buy the comic in full for ever and even a physical copy of the story? Girl I\u2019d bounce on that offer. I love some of these stories and would be more than happy to add them to my book shelves.","1084":"The daily pass thing is really annoying. Let\u2019s say for example, I\u2019m reading a super good interesting story that has got me hooked and then all of sudden when I go to the next chapter... BOOM FAST PASS. Like it\u2019s so annoying have to wait a whole day just to read something because I can\u2019t spend any money yet cause I\u2019m young. I get the whole revenue for creators and all that but it\u2019s so annoying and really makes this app go to crap. So please get rid of it or change it to be better. It\u2019ll make your ratings go up.","1085":"It\u2019s a great reader and platform, although I pity new users for not being able to experience the freedom this app had in its earlier days. Recently with its implementation of many features that limit reading it\u2019s become quite a drag. Still a good reader only that it could get annoying, rather it will. But it\u2019s in an effort to support the authors more, so for a valid reason such as that not much can be said or done.","1086":"I love that all the webtoons are free unlike on other sites where you get to read a few and then have to pay for the rest. Sure you have to wait for the episodes but they are eventually free. Also there was a bug that wasn\u2019t allowing me to read at all even when I redownloaded but I got an update less than two days after it started and it fixed it completely.","1087":"I think that this is a wonderful app and I love that you can pay to see episodes early but can still read it all if you wait. There are a ton of different genres that you can read so it\u2019s not all cheesy romance. In my opinion some of the best comics on there are a couple horror ones. The only complaint I have is that lately it has been a little laggy and after I exit a comic I need to wait a while for everything to load in.","1088":"Hey, I can no longer read comics due to a slight bug. The screen goes to whatever color is the backdrop to the chosen comic, but besides the color, it is blank. There\u2019s nothing for me to choose. And I can\u2019t even go back to the screen I was on beforehand. I\u2019m unsure if the app is crashing or something, but it doesn\u2019t kick me off of the app when this happens. I really love Webtoon, and would like to continue using it, but it\u2019s impossible to do so with this issue.\n\nSorry to bother y\u2019all about this!","1089":"I love the app very much but I think the app needs to save chapters on different devices cause I was reading hooky for summer reading and I went to my iPad cause my iphone was  gonna be died soon so when I went in I noticed that nothing was save my stories I read weren\u2019t submitted as my comic even I went to hooky and none of the chapters were saved I was mad cause I was reading that a lot just to win coins (because I\u2019m young;) I hope you fix this pls \n\nSincerely Sora Valkyrie ( a fake name)","1090":"I have had reoccurring problems with the app saying that it can\u2019t connect to WiFi even when I have full \u201cWiFi bars\u201d or I have mobile data on I\u2019ve done everything I can with my settings and nothing works so I end up uninstalling the App and reinstalling it which only seems to temporarily fix the issue as I have had to do this process 3 times now I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a bug or what but I love webtoons so ide like to be able to use with out having to uninstall and reinstall it every 3- 4 weeks \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude24","1091":"I love this app like don\u2019t get me wrong there are amazing stories on here. But the things is that I hate is like when you finish a amount of stories then you pay for the rest of the story like no I don\u2019t wanna waste my money  like I mean come on. And if I don\u2019t buy it I have to wait 20 days to read it. And when that day comes before you read it it\u2019s says for you to wait another 16 hours in order to read it. Other than that it\u2019s a good app. I\u2019m just saying my opinion","1092":"I love this app I really do. I love the content and the overall idea of this app. But I don\u2019t love the newest update. We used to be able to tap the bottom of the screen to scroll through the comic and now we aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not so lazy that it\u2019s too much to scroll through it manually but I\u2019ve gotten used to it and it\u2019s disappointing not to be able to do it anymore. If you could just put the option of it back on the app I think it would help a lot of people","1093":"Hello, yes this would be hard to most over to a device like an iPad, Tablet. \nBut I would love it for you guys actually put the \u201cpublish a webtoon\u201d into iPad and Tablet as well, since most or some  people don\u2019t actually use a computer for the comics to be made. So, yeah I am just kid so you don\u2019t have to listen to me XD. This is just my opinion on why you should transfer it down to both the iPad and Tablet.","1094":"I really like this app, but I would like to know if there is a way to create your own Web toon story. If there is, I just don\u2019t know yet because I\u2019m a noob. But it would be great if you could make a thing so you can create your own web toon story or explain how whenever someone downloads the app. Besides that, I can\u2019t stop reading the intriguing stories on this game and I\u2019m glad it exists.","1095":"I have been hooked on WEBTOONS for awhile now. I am reading several webtoons atm and each author is amazing and has they\u2019re own unique style and story. Recently though many of the authors have had to fix and even recreate their stories due to the new policy changes concerning NSFW content. This has probably put authors into a bit of a pickle and I wish I could get webtoons a better rating but with the policy changes I can\u2019t bring myself to do so. I hope they change it soon so authors can work around for now I\u2019ll be looking for another webtoon app","1096":"Webtoon has a lot of great and beautiful comics I would give this a five star if it weren\u2019t for there new policy about the you know \u201csexy panels\u201d they made it so we don\u2019t get to see anything \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude22what was wrong with the censored version whoever made up this new policy I hope it was worth it to drop from a 5 star to a 3 star you would think I wouldn\u2019t care so much but I do I\u2019ve been with webtoon for 2 years I always go on it everyday but now I go on it a little Disappointed because of that policy other than that I fully recommend webtoon","1097":"I loved WEBTOON for such a long time but now all of a sudden they changed they 18+ policy and now nsfw isn\u2019t allowed on the platform. This is the only way I can read any of these comics and now they are censoring a large portion of the comics they have. It\u2019s really disappointing to see this. Not to mention it would be super helpful to have a LGBT section to brows but the furthest they went was to feature some lgbt comics for pride month only. Pride month isn\u2019t the only time I wasn\u2019t to read lgbt comics and it\u2019s super difficult to find them in with all the other comics. WEBTOON is disappointing me greatly these days. :( fix these two problems and we\u2019d be back to a 5 star rating.","1098":"This app is great for those looking for free comics. It has stories from many genres such as, action, romance, sports, fantasy, sci-fi, and many more. \n\nThis app is also great for aspiring comic makers. They can create their own comics in the discover portion of the app for free. If the webtoon creators love their work they can be featured, which means they will get paid monthly for making their comic. \n\nGreat entertainment for comic lovers, and great opportunity for those who want to make a career out of comics.","1099":"Ok here\u2019s my take.....they have good and enjoyable webtoons at disposable for leisure reading. Though some chapters are locked if you don\u2019t mind spending a few bucks here and there it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. However if you\u2019re looking for more adult content (smut) or big hitters like solo leveling or the beginning after the end then you\u2019re better off on free sites that are around. Overall not a bad app as they do tend to follow the weekly releases and have a wide variety to keep you satisfied","1100":"So a lot of people are complaining about the daily pass thing- but honestly this has not been an issue for me. There are plenty of comics that DON\u2019T use daily pass. While I am not a fan of micro transactions, they haven\u2019t gotten in my way in this app. And the fast pass thing goes directly to the authors, and they are not mandatory. That is ok IMO.\n\nAnyways, great app and I appreciate that it is (mostly) free to use. \n\nThe only thing is that it drains my battery REALLY fast. I have no clue why. Also, lately it has been acting up. I\u2019ll be reading, and suddenly it will start to freeze my phone, and I have to restart my iPhone. I am curious as to why this app is so demanding on my phone. Also my phone gets warm when it does the freeze thing.... yeah idk maybe that is a bad sign. \n\nAnyways, great app otherwise.","1101":"I love webtoon. I love this app. It's easy for making my webtoon. But bruh. Daily Pass?!? No. Bad. When fast pass was introduced I was hesitant but now I see it was a good way for creators to make a little extra on comics they work hard on. But Daily Pass is just ridiculous. We want to read finished webtoons. This app is good because it's based on all webtoons being free to read. It seems unfair to make us pay for completed series especially when right now lots of people can't afford it. Based on the one free episode daily, if you were reareading a webtoon that had 400 episodes and couldn't afford daily pass it would take OVER ONE YEAR to complete the reread. Bs.","1102":"The daily pass is one of the worst things they\u2019ve added for this app. Before that this app was the go to for reading new and interesting stories like Tower of God, I've bought fast pass for tower of god and hardcore leveling warrior as a way to help the creators but the daily pass is a terrible addition. It requires you to for episodes on series that are already completed or ones that you\u2019ve read in the pass. I\u2019m okay with spending coins on a fast pass but not on this daily pass so sadly I\u2019ll be looking at alternative apps","1103":"Bad for making new ones. My canvas is a great new addition for those allowing the people to making their own new webcomic. However the problem lies for mobile users who've drawn comics on mobile. I'd appreciate if there were addition for user such as myself to be able to publish comics on mobile. \n\nOtherwise, it's a great app in which I tune into works that i'm interested in.","1104":"The fast pass thing is kind of annoying, and are the creators of the comics the ones getting paid with the fast pass ? Because if so then I totally understand, but if not then it\u2019s kind of unfair and annoying. Also, I think mobile users should be able to post their own web toons ? If feels like a lot of artists are being left out.","1105":"Great stories and format, but I\u2019ve had to switch logins recently due to my friends wanting to get on their profile to read their favorite comics. But every time they log out of mine I\u2019m never able to get back in. The menu keeps saying my email isn\u2019t registered and even though I know it is I\u2019ve tried to make a new profile with the same email, and it\u2019s says the email is already in use! Webtoon needs to fix this ASAP. I\u2019m missing all the comic updates!!!","1106":"webtoon is one of my most used apps and i love the comics on it. i don't care about the fast pass or anything but whenever i click on the app, it always takes an abnormal amount of time for it to load. not only that, but when you click on a comic to read it, it doesn't load. all you get is the background color with the button that says \"go to 1st ep.\"  but everything else is blank. even if i refresh it, this still happens. it's getting very frustrating fix it.","1107":"I\u2019ve had this app for years and I love it to death but recently it\u2019s started to bug out where it says there\u2019s no internet connection but my internet is just fine. I\u2019ve have to delete the app then download it again but I lose my place in all my readings which is annoying. Still giving 5 stars cuz this app is amazing and the creators are awesome. But please fix this if you can.","1108":"This app has multiple series of stories which are amazing, but this app cuts off a few episodes of a series you are reading to force you to wait 26 or more days until you could read it. It has a label which is called \u201cFast Pass\u201d to force you to use money to buy coins to earn the episodes. I do not understand why the app needs this attention, but the people who write series and have multiple fans who read it support the app. Therefore, it has support from the people using and creating series.","1109":"This is a great app for anyone who likes horror, fantasy, drama, funny, romance, or just any genre there is out there. There are some really good weebtoons that are just amazing and some that you will enjoy. There are no problems with this app and if your looking to read offline, you can always download the weebtoons while under WiFi so you can enjoy them anywhere. This is overall a great app and I\u2019m satisfied of how well this app is.","1110":"Ok I love this app because there are so many really good stories in it!!! And also that I can read these when I want on my phone! Tho so one of the best apps I have ever had! And I have had a whole bunch of apps. If you are reading this you should read Lore Olympus! It is the best story I have ever read in my life!!!!!!! I also love how all of the stories have pictures it is easy to understand! This is why I give this app a 5\/5 rating!","1111":"I didn\u2019t like reading, until I came across this app I really enjoy it. Their aren\u2019t any problems I have this is just a suggestion that should be added\n\nYou should add something for us to earn coins I believe it would be a great idea for us if we read a minimum of 2 stories for stories for a coin(s) instead of buying them other than that I don\u2019t have any problem with the app it\u2019s amazing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4c","1112":"I have had this app for a while now. It just so great. All the WEBTOONs on it SFSU bet duper great!!!! There are some really great ones too. Best part about is that it\u2019s FREE. It\u2019s so addictive but that\u2019s great because some WEBTOON stories updates every week. So their that great that wait week for a new episode. But my favorite part is you can read as many as you want to. This will make you want to read even if you don\u2019t like reading. Get now! You will love it! I promise \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude03","1113":"I\u2019ve had this app for years now and really love the collection of comics. It\u2019s 4 stars because Webtoon won\u2019t let many of the popular series continue. Any artist who wants to publish on this app as one of their originals or get into a serious partnership with them should be aware that at any time they can stop publishing your chapters even if you submit them. Some artists have been waiting over a year or even years for their stories to come out.","1114":"I have faithfully been using WEBTOON for years now, but new policies are making it hard to enjoy. The worst is that I cannot even use the app now since it freezes in the main screen. Please fix it soon I don\u2019t want to read anything else.\nEdit: The main screen is fixed, but I still have freezing issues. When I open the comic it\u2019s fine, until I try to scroll and it freezes. I have to go through the efforts of constantly closing and reloading the app and it only works after 5+ times. LET ME READ MY COMICS I NEED THEM TO RELIEVE MY DEPRESSING LIFE.","1115":"I love WEBTOON but now I can\u2019t even read my favorite WEBTOONs because they are no longer allowed to post anything nsfw. It\u2019s sad that a lot of artists are now going to stop posting the stories they originally planned on sharing with their followers. Or if they do post they have to cut out chunks from the stories. \nAnytime before this policy WEBTOON would have gotten a 5 star rating from me. But now my rating is lowered because all of the recents updates from my favorite webtoons are saying their stories will be edited or because they don\u2019t want to change the way their story is they will no longer post at all on WEBTOON. Not happy at all \ud83d\ude14\nI do hope that this will be fixed","1116":"So I love this app so much I have had it for years one of my favorites was Gourmet Hound and I love it so much that I would always download it but when I tried downloading it because it had expired it never let me download it again and access so I can\u2019t download one of my favorites and I really wish I could. And I also had deleted an episode from another series and the second I did that I  instantly regretted it because you can only download it once \ud83d\ude2d","1117":"This App is really good because the series in this App are awesome! And the cliffhangers are really good, even if it\u2019s a cliffhanger, the next episode comes really quick but not all is like that. All of the series I found are really good! I\u2019ll recommend y\u2019all some: Rebirth (kind of scary), Watermelon (sad), See You In My 19th Life (hella good! It\u2019s so juicy \ud83d\ude0e). You should really download this app for reading in your free time since we are all stuck at home. :>","1118":"I\u2019ve had this app on and off since it was released. I absolutely love it. I do wish story progress got saved onto our accounts some how so if I had moved devices, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through the whole stories again to find my place. Another issue I\u2019ve been having is that the app crashes if I scroll too fast but I\u2019m a fast reader so I can\u2019t help it.\nOtherwise, love the stories and the interface and everything else about the app.","1119":"let me start of by saying i absolutely loved webtoon it has amazing stories and creators out there, but then they decided to add daily pass which just ruined my experience. i would usually binge a story or re-read some stories and they would usually contain 100+ episodes; now i have to wait to unlock chapters and i can\u2019t read it through one sitting. i understand that they are trying to monetize and make money but it makes it less likable to the reader. i personally like to sit down and just scroll and read until i have finished but the daily pass feature just interrupts my reading and puts it to halt leaving me on a cliff hanger. if your ok with reading 3 chapters per day then go ahead (not all stories have daily pass it\u2019s usually the ones that are completed) but nevertheless it is still a good app just not as great as it once was.","1120":"Although its still not to the quality it was before, I am glad for them listening to my feedback and updating the platform. It gives me hope that they actually care about their users feedback. Its still a little awkward to find things as all the images are so large and take up so much space but I can live with it as long as it doesn't automatically open up the episode.","1121":"The stories are enjoyable and I definitely read through them nonstop when I can. The interface works well too. However, the app does sketchy things like recently when it ate through the battery of my brand new iPhone overnight with 5+ hours of background activity. That\u2019s 80% which would normally last through an entire day and then some of continual onscreen use. Really sketchy. What was it even doing during that time?! Scary stuff. But ugh I love the stories too much to delete the app.","1122":"I\u2019ve not accessed Webtoons for 2+ weeks due to vacation and now I come back to catch up on everything and it forces me to log in again and once I do, ALL of my subscriptions are gone. I have the recently read list, but I had over 50 subscriptions and now there\u2019s nothing there. This app has really gone downhill since the update regarding the nsfw policy with many artists removing their content. I\u2019m disheartened now because I have to go back and subscribe to all the comics again, but it\u2019s already extremely hard to find comics since there\u2019s no real way to see all comics at once, only searching by category or name of comic\/artist.","1123":"Ok. Everyone in the reviews are trash talking about the new update. Let's be real. IF YOU WANT 18+ STUFF PLZ DON'T HATE ON AN AMAZING APP AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Like really just stop. The app is recommended for 9+ not 18+ so stop with the rude reviews. That's your problem if you nasty and want mature content. Plus the author has to draw this stuff down. I assure anyone who is having a hard time deciding to get this app because of its \"Negative Reviews\". I promise you'll love Webtoons for the long run.","1124":"I love WEBTOON and always will. But ever since the policy change about censorship, I felt as if they weren\u2019t fair. The artists are handicapped when it comes to drawing certain things already, but now artists must change stories in their ENTIRETY to comply with the new policy. It is not right, and it is simply not fair to the hardworking artists of WEBTOON. If they worry about children seeing NSFW stories, maybe parents should be the ones checking on what their children look at. Needless to say, it should not have to hinder the artists in any way whatsoever.    Sincerely, SakuraDarkRose","1125":"The webtoons app is convenient for when I want to read my favorite webtoons on the go.  Issues are up for download as well!  So you can read them whenever you want and it's all free.  If you make an account all of your favorite webtoons show up in your account and the app bookmarks where you last read.  Best of all no pop-up ads.  From a free account you can do what you want.  Subscribe and read.","1126":"I absolutely love this app. There are so many good featured stories and Canvas stories too. However, on canvas stories that contain the ad feature to read new stories, the ads only work like 40% of the time. Can you guys need to fix this so it works all the time please? Lately it\u2019s been telling me to go to advertising and reset the ad identifier, but i have done that many times and the ad will still not play. Other than this bug, it\u2019s a great app.","1127":"I\u2019ll make this quick by saying I love webtoon and I think it\u2019s great. But it\u2019s impossible to use because it crashes so often. It will say that it\u2019s lost connection or is having issues and then it just doesn\u2019t work anymore. I know it\u2019s not my wifi because everything else works. And so far the only way I figured out how to fix this problem is uninstalling the app. I just cannot use this app with this problem it really needs to be looked into","1128":"I love webtoon!! I don\u2019t read it all the time but when I do I\u2019m on it for awhile I love all the story\u2019s I have saved on here so very much I even cry sometimes when reading. all of the artwork is Beautiful and uniquely different from each other! If you are thinking about downloading it you\u2019ll love it. I am a person who buy coins because I can\u2019t wait for the next episode and they are super cheap only a 1$ \ud83e\udd2d","1129":"I love the app it\u2019s great and free (except dads pass of course) the stories are just awesome. But when you get a new device you can\u2019t transfer the coins you do have to your new one and that\u2019s very annoying I lost over 20-30ish coins because of that. You awesome can\u2019t get the coins you got from a free coin rebate if you get a new device and that\u2019s very aggravating. Please find a solution for this.","1130":"I got attached to many comics but, I had to stop because of coins and fast pass. Maybe instead of coins and fast passes you should have a membership like you pay 5 dollars a month for a story that you would like to get spoilers or even bts, extras, and Q&A\u2019s. Instead of coins because unfortunately I have to stop reading comics and it\u2019s not only me and many people. Some parents don\u2019t like to pay for things like coins for an app. Many teens and kids don\u2019t have credit cards they can pay for this and it\u2019s just unfair overall except the coins I really like the stories and app.","1131":"I had no complaints with app whatsoever and it deserved 5 stars but this new update for the finished stories is so bad Most finished series are 100+ worth of Eps that\u2019s 2 months waiting why did you add that feature it\u2019s so dumb even when we open eps (which is only 2 mind you so if you opened the wrong Ep rip) they\u2019ll be open for 14 days!! Not permeant this update is trash please bring back the old version a lot of complaining is happening on it please listen to us","1132":"It\u2019s a lovely app with the best quality I love the layout of the whole thing. It is very well along with the comics within the app. Although I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re my coins went when I bought them. I bought them on a different device and I went to log in on my phone we\u2019re I usually read the webtoon comics and it says I have no coins. If you can please fix it , I was supposed to have 50 with a additional 2 coins on my webtoon account.","1133":"Let me explain. Starting at the time of writing this review, the app refuses to let me see any of the latest updates of the WEBTOONs I'm subscribed to or even reread any previously read works. I can't scroll, can't access the comics, if I am able to they don't load and even worse still, I'm still getting on time updates and yet I can't do anything.\nPls fix.","1134":"This app is great! I\u2019ve used it for a long time now and it\u2019s quite useful on a long day when I want to relax, the only problem I have is about the log in. I don\u2019t have any social media so I have no other way to contact Webtoon. When loging in and putting in my email then password it says that my email wasn\u2019t registered and I don\u2019t know how to fix it. Is there any way to?","1135":"So I first got WEBTOON because I saw it on tiktok. It was an episode on cursed princess club. I saw it and I like it and wanted to read it. So I downloaded the app. I read the series until it told be to wait for 2 DAYS!!!! I really like the app, but I can\u2019t wait 2 days for me to read most of the episode. I can\u2019t get coins because I\u2019m only 12, and my mom won\u2019t get it. It\u2019s a great app overall it just makes you wait to long. Please fix this! It would be the greatest app ever if you fixed that.","1136":"I\u2019ve downloaded this app a few months ago and since then I\u2019ve been ADDICTED! I downloaded it after multiple recommendations from friends, I just though it was an l app for anime lovers to read comics or something but once I downloaded its where I mostly spend time if I\u2019m on my phone. The stories are so amazing and I love them so much. I honestly don\u2019t know how I lived before I downloaded Webtoon. It\u2019s fantastic and my favorite app!!!","1137":"For everyone who says that webtoon is not\nfree anymore is wrong. I know that there\u2019s an update about the coins, but either way it\u2019s the same. With the coins you can get EARLY ACCESS, which means you can ready them early and not wait for a week. When webtoon didn\u2019t have the coins, you needed to wait 1 week for a new update or however much it took. It\u2019s literally the same thing people \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","1138":"I\u2019ve been using this app for over a year now and it has never let me down, up to this point. For certain comics, I usually buy coins to get ahead but for a week, there\u2019s a pop up that constantly tells me that there is an error every time I try to purchase more coins. I\u2019ve tried resetting the app, deleting and reinstalling the app, and I even tried contacting customer service!! Nothing has been in the works and I don\u2019t want to just wait until the next chapter of someone\u2019s comic to be available.","1139":"I've had this problem with how your account is made. I went to sign up and everything worked except for the fact that it kept saying \"Check your email address\" when it was perfectly fine. I put it in correctly and it kept saying this over and over. I tried clicking the \"Sign up Now\" button several times before it actually told me this. I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong or anything, I just want to let the developers know.","1140":"I love webtoon and the entire interface is so easy to use. However the app has been crashing a lot lately due to server issues\/poor connection. I also don\u2019t like that you can only buy fast passes with in app purchases. I like Tapas because on the website version I can buy w PayPal or a card. My account is linked to my parents so I can\u2019t buy in app without them knowing. Absolutely love the comics on here tho!","1141":"This app use to be great..I mean it\u2019s okay now, but this new policy has to GO, many authors can\u2019t even post their original chapter because of this new policy and nobody likes it, when I say nobody likes it I mean nobody! I\u2019m a big boyxboy lover and WEBTOON WAS the best place I could go to read that but because of your new policy it ruined everything!!! I think you should just make it easier for everybody and change your policy or get rid of it because it make this app great like it use to be. And if there\u2019s people complaining about NSFW, why are they reading it in the first place?!(especially if it\u2019s BL)Authors even have kept it censored\/covered so what\u2019s the problem!?","1142":"I\u2019ve liked WEBTOON ever sense I first downloaded it. It allowed me to read content you can\u2019t get normally in my family. It allowed me to read about excellently made characters that I related to, but a recent up date is changing that for me. So of my favorite webtoons relied on some of the things a new change in policy bans in order to tell a story. I still enjoy reading webtoons but it really pains me to see some of my favorite chapters or even my favorite story\u2019s be removed completely that is why i think webtoon was good but should change their policy back to what it was to support a wider range of artist.","1143":"Rating did not let me finish!  It submitted four stars before I could press the fifth star!!  Haste makes waste and it wasted my chance to submits five star rating.  Love this site!   Hope they can go back to earliest Enlish tranlations of Kubera by Currygom because they need to be as accurate as the recent translations.  We want new readers to be able to understand correctly the nuances of this complex mystery. I read Kubera, Magician, And Super Secret plus others.","1144":"This is what the internet and computers are for. With this app you get hundreds, of not thousands of comics made by people who just want to share a story, and an active community that\u2019s supportive in every meaning of the word. And if you ever feel so inclined you can make your own webtoon with just an idea and the inclination to draw. It has no pay walls or anything of the like, just happy people who want to share and explore.","1145":"Having a smooth interface and a very wide selection of comics to read, the WEBTOON app is a good way of getting your daily dose of comics. \n\nThere are some incredibly talented artists featured on WEBTOON. I have fallen in love with over 15 different stories and authors that I do not think I would know of without the ease of access to them afforded by this app. \n\nHighly recommend if only to use in small breaks within your day.\u2661","1146":"I\u2019m actually have a question and I\u2019m actually having difficulty with logging into web tunes on my new phone I tried logging in with Facebook and it brought me to a new account and so I entered in the right Facebook and it\u2019s not letting me enter that Facebook now it just keeps on saying use the Facebook you already logged in with","1147":"The app was amazing there is no denying it, the comics were great, the community is great, but the owners are actual cancer, not only are they turning it into a pay to read, but not really even paying their creators much, now the daily pass was made to support creators by giving them money off the coins spent on their series, but they actually only pay them a fraction. \nNow the concept is good except that their main selling point is free, and we could keep it free with more adds that go towards the creators but all adds go to the owners pockets\n\nIn short it\u2019s become pay to read and creators only get paid in dimes and pennys","1148":"I love Webtoon and all of the lovely stories in it, however to report a comment you just report it, you should be able to report spoilers, which are especially bad in things like True Beauty, and you should be able to report for bullying that sort of thing. If there were a better system for getting comments removed that\u2019d be a relief. It\u2019s also really unstable sometimes when loading parts, it used to crash a lot but now it\u2019s just really buggy until you\u2019ve scrolled.","1149":"I used to love WEBTOON. But now all it is about is money. I\u2019m rereading a book that was finished 5 years ago (where tangents meet, super cute I suggest) and I used to reread it all the time, but I can\u2019t even do that without having to wait hours to enjoy myself. I just want to be able to escape from the pressure of work and school and be able to feel happy with what I\u2019m doing. But apparently that can\u2019t happen without having to wait hours a day and\/or pay for chapters. Thanks guys, really helps. \ud83d\ude10 all about money pls bye","1150":"I like this app I really do they have some funny stories on there that I like to read but they added this pass thing so that it doesn\u2019t allow you to read 3+ chapters for a couple of days unless you have coins. I like this app but I\u2019m not willing to spend real money for overpriced coins to read new chapters that take 6-18 days each to unlock. I personally liked it better before this update but it\u2019s still a good app.","1151":"The app is WONDERFUL. There are so many interesting and captivating webtoons to read. You have an opportunity to truly support the artist and I think that\u2019s great. The only suggestion I have is to add a \u201clast read\u201d button or something of the sorts to read the last chapter I read instead of scrolling all the way down (especially when the webtoon has MANY chapters).","1152":"Honestly I used to like this app a lot but the Coins and the Daily pass its not fair anymore, They are some people who can\u2019t buy Coins or Daily pass which includes me\nAnd from that point of view it\u2019s not fun \nI think the better idea of earning money is just coins okay there\u2019s no point in putting daily passes that just ruins the webtoons and I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s even Interesting but disappointing or  a good idea\nBecause Daily Pass is so stupid and it\u2019s enough that some people can\u2019t read ahead  for not being able to afford it thanks to the Coins","1153":"I\u2019ve enjoyed webtoon for over a year now, and I love supporting content creators in as many ways as possible, but the ads just aren\u2019t it. They don\u2019t load, which means that for a week now, I\u2019ve been trying to read the new parts of my favorite series but I can\u2019t because the ads won\u2019t play. This isn\u2019t an issue on my end, because I\u2019ve watched plenty of other ads on other apps. If I can\u2019t access the content I came for, I\u2019m not going to keep using the app.","1154":"I\u2019ve been using the app and am entirely obsessed with the different comics. But recently the app has been glitching. It\u2019ll freeze while I\u2019m in the middle of a chapter and won\u2019t react or do anything when I tap on the screen. I have to get out of the app completely and give it a few minutes and hope it doesn\u2019t freeze again. It\u2019s only been happening for a few weeks but it\u2019s getting annoying. Please fix it!","1155":"I\u2019m a little late to this because i figured I\u2019d wait a pretty long time before even thinking of writing a review but my webtoon hasn\u2019t been loading at all for maybe the past 4 or 5 days. \nI\u2019m not obsessed with webtoon which is why I wasn\u2019t too worried when nothing was loading, i usually leave things alone for 2 or 3 days so i can binge read but now i\u2019m completely backed up on all my webtoons. some of them load (even if barely) but the majority of them just show blank grey screens. i assumed there was something wrong with the servers or something and it would be fixed but this is taking way too long.","1156":"I had this for many years off and on, but I deleted it earlier this year because of lack of storage. When I finally redownload it, I log in only to see that all my recents are gone, and all my progress on every single comic I\u2019ve ever read are gone as well. I even checked on the online version and this same thing, everything was gone. It still has my subscribed list but I don\u2019t remember when I last left off on them so this is really annoying and discouraging. If you guys can help me out that\u2019ll be great but until then, I\u2019m deleting webtoons again. Seeing everything gone is just too much.","1157":"First off I must say I love this app dearly. I do have a suggestion, though. I\u2019ve found there is no way to tailor the recommended or say that you don\u2019t like a certain series or genre. I think there should be a way to say that you don\u2019t like xyz, be it a specific webtoon or, for example, horror genre. There should be a hide series option or something to the degree of that. Not saying there are a ton of series I don\u2019t like the idea of, but there are definitely some living in my recommend that I know I won\u2019t read. Thanks for consideration!","1158":"Now I don\u2019t usually write reviews...as in I NEVER do reviews (unless they offer a prize for rating their app 5 stars lol) but I just really wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH for making it so that when I finish a chapter and exit back to my \u201csubscribed\u201d page, it\u2019s still at where I scrolled to before I tapped on a comic to read it. I love not having to start at the top of the list and scroll all the way down again. Tysm","1159":"There was recently a new policy, which many people do not like. I personally do not like it either. It doesn\u2019t allow \u201cinappropriate\u201d content. They usually warn the reader if there will be this content. You do not need to report it, you just click off of the story. Many of the Authors on this platform are having to take down their art- something that they have taken a long time to make. Please remove this policy, thank you for your time.","1160":"I love this app. I\u2019ve found so many great artists and creators and I use the app everyday. I\u2019ve been running into a bug with the startup however, that doesn\u2019t allow me to access the app. A couple seconds after launch it directs me to the home page, but then freezes. I cant use the app at all. I\u2019ve tried force quitting, restarting my phone, all of that fun stuff, but still nothing. It\u2019s really disappointing, and it\u2019s be great if you guys could fix it!","1161":"I love webtoon. I have had it for almost a year and I personally haven\u2019t had any problem with it. I would like to say that it would be cool if maybe in the next update, there was a way to organize your personal library. I am typically an organized person and I would just like to be able to organize it to my liking. Other than that I have absolutely no problem with the app.","1162":"I really loved WEBTOON until the new policy came around. Many of my favorite authors are being forced to quit because some people couldn\u2019t handle their comics. There were clear warnings and they should have known what would be there in the first place. They are not forced to read those comics. I truly wish this new policy would be removed. All the same I would still recommend this app. It is fun to read the great comics on here. One of my personal favorites is Saphie the One eyed cat.","1163":"Love this app to death! Until this new policy came up ( \u00ac_\u00ac) it\u2019s restricting a bunch of my favorite authors for having anything remotely NSFW or mature. Some of them even left WEBTOON and moved elsewhere. Find another way to ensure young readers don\u2019t read mature content or hard-hitting subjects instead censoring the creators! Forcing them to change stories they\u2019ve already planned out is unfair to them. It also ruins the reading experience to see our authors so frustrated because of this policy. I hope this policy changes soon because I\u2019ll just follow where the authors go if this keeps up.","1164":"WEBTOON used to be my go to app but because of this new stupid policy, people like me who enjoy the explicit stories have to suffer. If your not someone who can handle the stories posted don\u2019t look at them, this is a app where writers and authors come and let us the viewers see the work they put out. This isn\u2019t webtoon anymore this is PG-5. Meaning this app is turning into something made for kids. I\u2019m an adult who enjoys comics BL,GL,Slice of life. I\u2019m in no position to judge I have enjoyed every comic I\u2019ve seen on webtoon but now all everyone is talking about is the stupid policy. They can\u2019t have certain explicit things in the comic. That just takes away. I\u2019m completely done with webtoon.","1165":"I think WEBTOON is a wonderful app. I love the story\u2019s that are featured and the new ones I find in Discover I find every day. But recently WEBTOON brought along a new policy. The policy has forced many creators to change or completely rewrite their story\u2019s. The very same ones they worked so hard to make. I hope that WEBTOON will do something about this, like take back the policy or rewrite it so the creators of the affected story\u2019s don\u2019t have to give up on their comics or bend over backwards to rewrite it. But this is my opinion. I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with me.","1166":"I really love the selection of webtoons on this app. The format is really nice and easy to look at and I absolutely love the vertical panels. \n\nHowever, I do have some concerns or issues to bring up when it comes to log-ins. I want to log-in to my account with my email only and there really isn\u2019t an option to unlink Facebook, Twitter, etc. If the developers could create an option for users to unlink social media from accounts, that would be nice!","1167":"I really love this app! I look forward to reading this everyday and it\u2019s very easy to work. You don\u2019t have to pay for anything unless you want to, and none of the payment stuff is promoted by WEBTOON, but rather the individual artists themselves. I look forward to reading new chapters everyday, especially if the last episode was a cliff hanger. I definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone!","1168":"I love WEBTOON been using it since 2016 but ever since the stupid daily pass I dropped like 12 different WEBTOON because I\u2019m not gonna wait a whole day everyday for 1 or 2 eps, I mean I get when the comic has to update but the finished ones are good and daily pass immediately makes u not want to read and what about comics like sweet home that has been set up for failure after doing so good now u can only read one episode a day? No! Fix it plz. and u could do better without it like u was chasing the bag and then  made a hard right for no reason and now your lost","1169":"I know that you guys bought wattpad but you\u2019re about to lose a lot of money and users because most people come onto this app to read books and most of them are mature and you\u2019re removing those stories which is getting rid of most of wattpad\u2019s readers because you want to be more child friendly just don\u2019t let children onto the app you\u2019re restricting it for other people because you don\u2019t want children on an app that they\u2019re not supposed to be on that makes no sense","1170":"I CANT STRESS HOW MUCH I LOVE WEBTOON. Lately though the people in charge have been making creators leave because it\u2019s not appropriate or for other dumb reasons. I just wanted to say it because after have this app for around 5 year and having favorites and then they have to stop and leave. I just felt like I should say something so there it is. The app isn\u2019t all bad though there are some really good things though so I ask if you see what I\u2019m saying please speak out as well.","1171":"So Webtoon has this thing called a \u201cfast pass rebate\u201d and basically you can use a fast pass (5 coins) so after a certain amount of time you get that fast pass back. This doesn\u2019t apply though if there isn\u2019t a fast pass rebate occurring for the story you use it on. Anyways, on the last Unordinary fast pass rebate I did it and I never got my coins back. \n\nTo webtoon, I want my coins back cause they are hard to get for free and for actual money.","1172":"I love WEBTOON, I've been using this app for the last three years. Mostly because it's free and it has two specific comics I massively enjoy. However I do not like they're slowly making it so you have to pay for comics. Of course it's a company, you have to pay coders, advertisements, but I really don't think they should make it like Lehzin comics. It's upsetting because of how so many kids like me don't have money to pay for it.\nGET RID OF DAILY PASS","1173":"I\u2019ve been using the webtoon app for a couple years now and bought coins two weeks ago. After the most recent update, I had to confirm my birth date and sign in to my account again. When I did so, I could see all of my downloaded episodes and recently read comics, but all the comics I\u2019d subscribed to are gone. All of the coins I paid for are gone. All of the episodes I liked and the fast pass episodes I unlocked are gone. All of my comments are gone. I\u2019ve never had issues with this app until now and I am extremely upset. I hope this issue is fixed quickly.","1174":"I love Webtoon! I just got it today and I\u2019m already obsessed with it. Im also obsessed with a story called \u201cDown to Earth\u201d (Go read it) my only problem is that you have to wait until a part of a story is free or pay for it and I\u2019m not allowed to pay for them so I got a bit upset when I read all. (In less than an hour) Other than that, Webtoon is a great app and you should download it!","1175":"I really enjoy WEBTOON and all it has to offer. But recently, there\u2019s a new thing where you have to watch an add to read a new episode. Not all comics are like this , but I want to say this now before it gets worse. In my opinion, it kinda annoying. And yeah , I get the adds are for webtoon to make more money and stuff , but I\u2019m sure there might be other ways ( that aren\u2019t so annoying) to make money. Other then that , I don\u2019t have many complaints","1176":"I wake up and I\u2019m bored, so I decide to read some tower of god, lo and behold, the app won\u2019t even start up, let alone load, I uninstall and reinstall, even restart my phone a couple times and it still doesn\u2019t work, literally can even check the app because it doesn\u2019t even load in, I just see the the logo then my home screen. I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for a couple of years now, and let me tell you, it\u2019s basically become a part of my day to day life. For it to not even load is very upsetting, please try your best to fix this guys.","1177":"I mean I got into webtoon a few years ago but then I came back and I was like wow this is something I really like, and it\u2019s cool because there really is something for everybody. If you need any recommendations I like the awkward magic, the four of them, lore of Olympus, the croaking,fluffy boyfriend, and blood inc and those are just the ones I can name of the back of my hand there are so many good stories to read and fan girl\/boy over","1178":"Ok I\u2019m going to make this quick and short so recently I got this weird bug when I try to open up a comic it freezes and doesn\u2019t load so I decided to delete the app and load it up again but when I put in all my information and press login it says cannot load information and I keep retrying but it won\u2019t work and I make sure to put in the right information and I just want to fix it so I can go back to reading comics.","1179":"I love Webtoons I first found out about this by looking online for a story and found the website. Then I thought that the comics were always late so I downloaded the app, now it comes on time the story\u2019s and art is amazing.I think it is fair that we should wait a week because it probably takes so much time to draw and get inspiration for the story. I love every single story in Webtoons, they are amazing","1180":"I bought some coins for the first time with zero hiccups. It was great. Everything was Gucci. But then I tried to buy more, and when I did, it just had the little loading thingy and nothing more. So at first I thought it was my internet, but when I tried it again at after the bill was paid and weather clear, the same thing happened. I just want you guys to take my money, but it won\u2019t let me. Please help a sister out.","1181":"I love this app. I have been on it for 2-3 years. But I have been hearing complaints about the 18+ issue. So people are saying you are missing some episodes from the actual comic? I don't think I would like that. But overall love the app. Cried when Ghost Wife ended. Along with Orange Marmalade, oh holy and more. Screamed quite a few times because they left me on a cliffhanger. And want John to just please stop having hair gel. And and love Janial\/ Day","1182":"I absolutely LOVE this app!! The community is so nice and creative. I like how it isn\u2019t like a animation so you can go at your own pace and take your time to think about what\u2019s going on. My favorite series is True Beauty. My favorite catagory is originals because they have really good plots and drama. And it is like reading a comic, but on your device! I don\u2019t have any problems with this app and there are no ads ( yess I\u2019m so happy about that \u263a\ufe0f)","1183":"So my friend was reading WEBTOON and then a pop up showed up so she read 75 episodes of hooky but then September 1 is over now and she didn\u2019t win but I know what everybody does to win coins THEY JUST SPEED THROUGH IT THEY DONT READ IT ITS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN WE READ IT AND ITS REALLY AWESOME but I have a suggestion when you do An event that involves reading how about when they finish reading let\u2019s say 75 episodes we get a quiz so people won\u2019t speed thorough it all people do is not read 75 episodes And done btw hooky is really interesting","1184":"I\u2019ve had this app for a few years now and when they first introduced the coins I was alright with it, paying a little bit to see new comics before they were published didn\u2019t sound so bad. However, I recently tried to go back and read a completed series I haven\u2019t read in a while and it told me I needed to either pay coins to get to read it again or wait for a daily pass to read the comic one comic at a time. I find this to be completely unfair that Web Toons is blocking an old comic that I have al ready read the entirety of behind a pay wall.","1185":"I was using webtoon for a while a couple of moths ago. Then i deleted it because i realized I wasn\u2019t using it much, and needed more phone storage. I re downloaded it and i\u2019m overall very happy, except for the fact that they added the new coin system. I\u2019m not a big fan of that, since i don\u2019t want to have to pay to buy 5 coins per episode. I get really hooked, and then to continue i need to get coins. Overall a good experience on webtoon though.","1186":"I loved this app so so so much until the knew policy came out and the authors had to delete full episodes that had more than just mature actions it also had important parts of the story in them and I enjoyed it a lot less beachside I was missing most of the most important events and I couldn\u2019t recap all of the things I forgot no hate I really this app I just don\u2019t like the policy please take it down if you aren\u2019t being forced to do this thank you for reading","1187":"This app is great and let\u2019s time fly by really quickly, but sometimes when I get to the next episode of the WEBTOON I\u2019m reading than it just doesn\u2019t stop loading. But after a few try\u2019s it works again. And my device isn\u2019t broken. But other than that, it\u2019s still magnificent and if you don\u2019t have it already than I recommend you get it!","1188":"So, please let me start by saying \u2018I LOVE this app!\u2019. I love it so much better than the other one where you have to pay for coins. If their selling something on here it\u2019s very cheap. I personally recommend \u2018I love yoo\u2019 #notsistersponcered so toy all you sisters out there in the sister hood love this! (would recomend watching wengie tell you all about how good it is though hers is actually sponcered...lol) Welp I think that about wraps it up sisters...great app have FUN! \ud83e\udd70","1189":"Don\u2019t get me wrong I still love the app but there is currently a major problem I\u2019m having. Whenever I load the app it looks like its working - the webtoons will refresh - but I cant touch anything. No matter what I select, the \u201cMy\u201d for my subscribed, a webtoon on the front page, nothing works. I cant even scroll down on the front page. This has been going on weeks now.","1190":"When I first heard of WEBTOON I was in love with it. One day, I found out that y\u2019all had BL and I was so happy. I loved the app so much I would go on it daily, even tell my friends about it. But when the new policy came my world came crashing down. I realized that my favorite creators couldn\u2019t share NSFW content anymore without the sort being shut down completely. It makes me sad that the creators can\u2019t share NSFW anymore. I also hope that the policy will change one day.\n         \n                                Love,\n                             Webtoon fan","1191":"I love WEBTOON it\u2019s my go to comic app right next to tapas, but one thing I wish you had back is the ability to read other comics while waiting for another to finish downloading. I was able to do it a year or two back when I had my LG and I currently have an iPhone but after that year I wasn\u2019t able to do it anymore and so even when I leave the app to play a game while it downloads it stops and I really wish that feature was back. \ud83d\ude14","1192":"I've been obsessed with this app for a long time, but now the new restrictions are causing some problems with me. A lot of Discover Webtoons are either going to be reported, deleted, of plainly stop updating because of the guidelines. I honestly love this app, I don't mind the adds, it's surprising that it's free with all of the amazing content, and overall a great community, but now a lot of those great comics that plan on, well, NSFW content can't do it. In fact they can't even mention it without any drastic measures from the team. I just hope that the app can find a workaround to this so I don't have to complain even more.","1193":"I absolutely love WEBTOON. But, sense the day the policy changed I have been really sad and depressed because I knew that all of my comics that I am subscribed would leave WEBTOON or change it completely. Because of this change I am only going to rate WEBTOON  with 2 stars. I will still be signed in and read some of the WEBTOON that are up. WEBTOON was my life and I loved and lived for reading WEBTOON and now that it changed I have grown depressed and sad. I\/We don\u2019t care about the improvements of WEBTOON. I\/We want WEBTOON back. We don\u2019t want change. I hope someone sees this and change their minds and keeps WEBTOON the way it is. We want WEBTOON back.","1194":"I love Webtoon, like a lot. Though I haven't used the app since sometime in 2019. However, I come back in December 2020 to find that a daily pass is required to read some completed series? I never got to finish Sweet Home, and it's my favorite comic. I was also planning to reread Refund High School, but the daily pass situation has definitely tainted my appeal with the app. That's all I really wanted to say, so please remove the daily pass and let us read the Webtoons, thanks.","1195":"I love WEBTOON best thing ever the comics are amazing, fun and entertaining it\u2019s so cute and  just EEEEEEEE. Recently whenever I try to go in and read it keeps kicking me out and saying can\u2019t be loaded or I have no inter when I have full ba to and everything. I\u2019ve tried re installing it and stuff it just still won\u2019t work please fix this it\u2019s Ming me mad and driving me nuts that I can\u2019t read any of my fav comics. Please please fix it please","1196":"I love reading WEBTOONs, and I most definitely have purchased coins to fast past certain series. HOWEVER, it\u2019s already happened twice where I have to request a refund through Apple because I get charged for \u201cpurchasing\u201d coins when I didn\u2019t. I am the only one who uses my phone so I know it\u2019s not anyone else purchasing them. I\u2019ve had this app for more than a year and it\u2019s happened twice in the last two months. I really love this app but if it happens again, I will be deleting the app.","1197":"A year ago I would\u2019ve given this app 5 stars without a thought, but now that they only allow you to view a limited number of episodes from a completed series each day, I want to give it 1 star. But the ongoing series are great, so I\u2019m giving it 2. I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m now having to wait a day per episode now that it\u2019s complete when I already had to wait for each episode to be released. This is utter bs and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long until current webtoons are limited like this, as well.","1198":"I\u2019ve had Webtoon for over three years, and enjoyed how all the stories were free to read. When they suddenly introduced the paid feature to unlock stories earlier than anyone else, I was iffy. Of course, I didn\u2019t complain about it as it didn't personally affect me. \n\nNow they have locked all my favorite stories i read years ago, only allowing me to read one chapter per day? \n\nAs someone had said earlier, they are begging for these stories to become pirated and for others to read them elsewhere. Honestly I\u2019m sick of Webtoon at the moment.","1199":"Webtoon has been apart of my life since 2017 and I\u2019ve read many webtoons and have certain favorites I like to reread every year for nostalgic reasons. You\u2019ve added daily passes which removes the want for me and many other to reread or read finished comics. This has deeply saddened me because now I can\u2019t have a nice night rereading my favorites when I\u2019m not doing well because I either have to pay or wait. This is too big of a change and it\u2019s incredibly disrespectful to everyone who uses your app. Reminds of when poptropica made almost everything behind a membership. You\u2019ve failed me.","1200":"So when I first open the app I was presented by a layout that I was really happy with, but then I wanted to create a account I did that, when I did the format changed a lot, it was now difficult to read any comic on it. It also was telling me to get the app for WEBTOON when I was signed in, I tried to sign in again but it didn\u2019t help can you please fix this I love the story\u2019s on the app but it is very annoying for me to read them.","1201":"Webtoon has opened my eyes to the wonderful world of webcomics....But every single time I finish a page and go to the best one there\u2019s an ad that pops up saying \u201cCheck out Webtoon Canvas\u201d or something along the lines of that. Everyone I click on it NOTHING HAPPENS. And it\u2019s annoying....SUPER ANNOYING. I get you want to get word across about Webtoon Canvas but you really don\u2019t have to put an ad up everyone I click something....I really don\u2019t want to go on Webtoon if this is going to continue","1202":"The version that introduced active consent for personal data tracking made things pretty bad. \n\nOpted out of all tracking and analytics and now swipe from the left doesn't work to go back from the WEBTOON to the list of WEBTOONs nor does the back button, in order to navigate back I have to minimise the app and come back to make it responsive and whenever it transitions between view controllers the animation moves the view WAY out of the window's bounds until after 3 or 4 webtoons it stays halfway \"outside\" the window and you are forced to kill the app in order to keep using it.","1203":"The overall app is amazing!\nThere are a few minor nit picks, but those are just small things that don\u2019t ruin my overall opinion on the app. The only real complaint about the app is that it freezes a lot. Like when I try to go from one issue of a comic to another, it just freeze completely, and doesn\u2019t let me do anything. But overall, I think this is a solid 4\/5 gold stars!","1204":"I love this app, it\u2019s really good. But I do have a question. Will there ever be an account login that will save all the comics that is read? For example if I buy a new phone and I have to re-download the app all the books i\u2019ve added to my reading list will be gone, right? So I was wondering if accounts are going to be added to this app so I can login and all the comics are saved. Thank you.","1205":"WEBTOON is absolutely amazing and free, unless you\u2019re paying to get more chapters faster. You don\u2019t have a limited amount that you can read, you just have to wait for the content creators to finish new chapters. \n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t read anything right now, and I don\u2019t know why. Every time I open the app, it says I don\u2019t have any internet, but every other app is working fine.","1206":"I used to love this app until they introduced this ludicrous feature called \u201cdaily pass.\u201d One of my favorite things about Webtoon was being able to binge read the completed series, but now that ability has been taken away from me. I\u2019m not going to pay or wait for something that has already been completed, that\u2019s nonsense. Reading for free was one of Webtoon\u2019s biggest advantages and now they\u2019ve just forfeited that advantage. What a shame...they should just sell physical copies of these stories if they need more money because I know for a fact a lot of people would love to buy them.","1207":"I love this app and i\u2019ve been reading this for a couple hours now and I just realised how much my finger is starting to hurt. I would love for you to add a system where it autoscrolls and you can change the speed.(maybe even do something like words per second where it scroll depending on how many words there are) This would make it seem more like a anime which I would love.","1208":"So when I went to the app like always I see this error saying that there is something wrong with my internet or there is no WiFi. It keeps on popping up on my screen! I literally use this app so many times but the WiFi problem! When I have four bars it still says I have a WiFi problem! This bug something is super annoying. To fix this I have to delete and then reinstall but it happens again! I love the comics and everything but this annoying bug is melting my brain! Please help me find a way to stop this!","1209":"WEBTOON is great and all but I have one problem. When I first downloaded it I was in China taking a vacation or more like meeting my relatives but when I got back to America the uploading time was still the same time as I was in China so right now today\u2019s Friday it\u2019ll upload something on Saturday. So everything uploads a day ahead cause of the time in China and I don\u2019t know how to change it even when my time is already set to where I\u2019m living and not China. Please fix this.","1210":"This was my favorite reading app ever I been using this app for like 3 years but it\u2019s turning into a pay to read and I am still too young to make any money it used too be a free community where artists would put their content and webtoon would get its money from merch but soon I bet it won\u2019t be free anymore and become like other webtoon companies I beg you webtoon be like you once were.","1211":"We understand that it needs to be handled for younger kids who aren't 18+ \ud83d\ude10 Trust me, we adults are getting that message loud and clear. What we aren't hearing though is how this new policy does anything but cut us down from our enjoyment. There needs to be something done so that the adults on this app can read our stories in peace without the threat of them being taken down because of the kids. We are being punished for something no one can control, but I hate to see all the bad reviews and complaints on an app that was once so popular and amazing its all I heard about. But that isnt the case now and it saddens me... please reconsider.","1212":"WEBTOON was a perfect app I would always read the new updates the second I got a notification but recently the new policy has damaged most of the creators because the dumb policy. Can I say when it says are you 21+ and you click yes you should be able to view the content you were asked about you should not get a Censored version but now the new policy it doesn\u2019t even allow the word of \u201csex\u201d or anything even related like a joke if they actually changed it for the good and not make it worse when it was better before that would be great","1213":"I love webtoon but the only 100 discover titles is kind of frustrating and the new discover policy is ruining Everything please take it down or reconsider. Slot of other fellow users agree with me so please listen to our Pleads. This is now ridiculous. One of my favorite Webtoons is now ending because of the stupid new discover policy. You hear this Webtoon? Your new policy is making creators end their comics because of some dumb rule. It is absurd that all these comics are ending just because of one little policy. Please rethink this through","1214":"WEBTOON offers a variety of genres and beautifully developed comics. This app is simple and easy to use and allows readers to rate their favorite stories. I love this app so much, especially since I\u2019m an anime and manga enthusiast. For those who love watching anime and reading manga, I\u2019d recommend this app! WEBTOON gives distinct and abstract stories and such detailed illustrations. As of now, I have no criticism for the app but improvements down the line would be most appreciated!","1215":"Well I've been reading webtoons for almost a while and it's so awesome! I get to read great comics with different styles and genres which allows all readers to find their taste. My favorites are freaking romance, unordinary, let's play, lore Olympus. Age matters, plum orange marmalade, days of hana odd girl out, toaster dude and sweet home and even though they're all great comics these are just the best so if you wanna support this app and the creators that would be great\ud83d\ude00\u2665\u203f\u2665\u3002\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61","1216":"I love this app very much, but I only have one problem about it. It\u2019s page are too big and for me to appreciate the art I have to use my two fingers and try to make it smaller but once I let go it becomes bigger and I can\u2019t appreciate the art, so I just want y\u2019all to give us the option to let us choose how small the width of the screen are. Thank you.","1217":"I love the app but the fast pass episodes are annoying I want to read them but I don\u2019t have coins and am not spending money I told myself that I wouldn\u2019t spend money on game beside for them and I have to wait a week to read another episode I understand they need to make money and that is another way not just ads for other things but it still is annoying","1218":"This app used to be my favorite comic app ever but then they added the daily thing and I think that it is very dumb how I can only read one almost every week. Sometimes I have to wait a week and then look and it say that I still have to wait another 12 days. I just want to read my comic in quarantine. Also not all of us are allowed to pay for the coins to get the next pass. I just think that they should take that part off. Then the app would be much better.","1219":"I have had this app for about 2 years now, and it is a good place to read comics! But lately they have been money hungry. They have this thing where you pay 5 coins to read episodes that haven\u2019t come out yet. Which I thought was fair. Now they want you to watch ads and PAY MONEY for episodes that have come out already! An example is \u201cGirls of the Wild\u201d. I had started re-reading it just for fun, but it said I needed to pay or watch ads for it. Please don\u2019t download if if you want to SPEND MONEY on it. Please remove that. I don\u2019t think people want to watch or pay money for episodes that have come out already.","1220":"The content is all free which is amazing and they even give out occasional free coins! I still have this app a 4\/5 just because I found it that the fast pass is 5 coins PER CHAPTER you want to read ahead. I understand they have to make money, but I\u2019d honestly be more open to paying a flat rate for a set amount of time of fast pass rather than having to use coins every single chapter. It\u2019s tedious and makes me feel like I\u2019d rather buy real comics.","1221":"Hi there, i was quite pleased with how  this app worked  but ever since i changed my password, it wont let me use the app. I logged in but it says im not and keeps taking me to the in-app website log in page and the app has also been freezing on me when i open it. Ive also tried logging back out and logging in again and even deleting the app and redwonloading. no luck :(","1222":"The app keeps freezing and not allowing me to scroll on any screen. Plus it won\u2019t load and preview pictures. At first I thought it was a cache issue, so I cleared it. But that didn\u2019t work. I then tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn\u2019t work either. All that did was cause me to loose my place in all of my comics because there\u2019s no way to properly bookmark across devices. I love all the comics, but I can\u2019t deal with this kind of slowness, and it\u2019s difficult to read on a laptop due to the layout.... please fix the glitches!!!","1223":"Personally, I love reading the countless comics on this app with barely any disturbance from the ads. However I\u2019m experiencing a problem where the app suddenly freezes and I have to close it and reopen it multiple times. Not sure why this is happening and I have deleted and downloaded the app again, only for it to freeze. I\u2019d appreciate it if the developer can contact me quickly so I can continue reading the comics.","1224":"I like to download episodes so I can read in my commute. I have over 100 GB of storage on my phone and about 2 GB of storage in iCloud, but a message saying \u201cnot enough storage\u201d pops up when I try to download some episodes. I\u2019ve tried clearing the cache and deleting and reinstalling the app and even restarting my phone, but nothing seems to help. Is this a bug?","1225":"This app is amazing and I absolutely love reading these web comics!!! They are made by amazing people and super fun to read! But maybe there should be an option to organize the \u201cMy\u201d section yourself. Like adding a choice to put webtoons into sections like \u201ccurrent reads\u201d, \u201carchived\u201d, and maybe reading lists? I really hope you can take this into consideration because I think it would improve the app a lot and make it a lot more organized!!! Thank you!","1226":"I love the story\u2019s but I think it\u2019s ridiculous that you have to wait 5 days or so at a time to read the end so far of the episodes. The story\u2019s are amazing full of life beautifully drawn, lots of life and color. But the wait time it out of proportion. It\u2019s kind of unfair to people who get the app read a whole story then I have to wait 17 days to read the last 3 episodes. It\u2019s just kinda annoying. Or you could pay to speed it up. But like unfortunately not everyone is able to pay for that kinda stuff. Well that\u2019s my rant. Good story\u2019s. Terrible wait time.","1227":"Has such a wide variety of options to read from and helps so many new artists create and show their skills and talents. Love that there is nk subscription fee or rate and you don't have to spend any money to read. Also that there are no pop up ads that slow you down from reading your heart out. Truly a wonderful app! Wish there were more like this","1228":"Webtoon is over all an amazing app, where artist and authors can express themselves and people can read amazing comics. I love how everything is set up, it\u2019s easy to find comics from discover and webtoon and there are endless amounts of stories. You can also crest your own, but you can only be subscribed to 100 comics which I think there shouldn\u2019t be a limit cause then it\u2019s hard to access all of the comics you want to read. I highly recommend this app","1229":"Omg this app\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\ude04I\u2019ve fan girled so many times. These stories are on point. I\u2019ve read 2 comics so far: true beauty, fluffy boyfriend. And now I\u2019m reading: I love Yoo, right now. I\u2019m enjoying this app. I just got it yesterday. The books are very funny, interesting and cute. And I also like the fact that new episodes come out all the time. All the authors are very talented and this app is my fav\ud83d\udc9c This is my second review intact! I love it so much. Ty for this app\ud83d\udc9c","1230":"WEBTOON is one of my favorite apps, but there\u2019s things I think that should be fixed like the no more than 100 WEBTOONs (idk wat they r called :I) can be subscribe to. That one is and easy fix, but another is the newish policy about NSFW but there could be a separate app or a part u could go into  and view them. It\u2019s pretty much a switch u can turn on and off. Both of these have been complain about a lot so please try and do both, and at least make it so u can sub to more than a 100 WEBTOONs.\n\nP.S. wat r the stories called. I am pur confusion ;-;","1231":"So this app is outstanding and it works well but everyone is hating the top reviews are three stars like what the heck and everyone who writes a review that scrolls on for like 12 seconds has too much time on their hands. They are most likely fat people living in their mom\u2019s basement so don\u2019t listen to those reviews that have three or lower they all don\u2019t have friends are complete losers with no life.","1232":"Great App! It Really Is! It Has Alot Of Intresting And Awsome Comics To Binge Watch or mayber Binge Read? I Dont know lol, I wouldve givin this app 5 stars but the think i dont like about the app is i cant use it on the go or in school because i dont have data and my schoold oesnt have wifi, so if there could be an update where you could download comics (whole series) and then read those downloaded comics with no wifi that would be great! i hope you consider this request! thanks for giving me awsome comics!","1233":"I am very disappointed for the new guidelines  Webtoon has given to the creators, it gives them less freedom of drawing and Uploading which is just completely unfair. Especially for Yuri\/Yaoi Authors, it\u2019s not only unfair to them but it\u2019s unfair to us because these authors are now choosing\/Being forced to post these uncensored\/Censored comics on their Patron and some people like me can\u2019t pay to be one.\nI believe that if Webtoon wants more people to go onto their app they should remove these guidelines.","1234":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for 1year now and with this new policy most of my favorite authors are  taking taking down the comics and finding new websites to put them on which I can\u2019t reach to or others and I think there\u2019s a better way we can arrange new policies but not in a way that takes down other authors hard work taking down or having to delete them  and I spent days waiting for a new comic to come out but then see it be taken down by WEBTOON or delete because of this new policy \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dplease fix it me an other readers are very upset with this new policy \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22","1235":"I love webtoon and read comics basically every day but now that there is this new policy, my favorite authors can\u2019t continue their stories how they planned. If a reader didnt want to see adult content then they shouldn\u2019t have clicked on the comic to begin with. The authors give warnings for 18+ or mature content. For the love of creativity and these wonderful artists... please don\u2019t continue to enforce this policy. Other then that WEBTOON is wonderful. Tons of awesome art and great story lines!","1236":"It\u2019s a good app, been using it for four years or so without complaint (aside from daily pass, but others have leveled their complaints and i understand why creators want it). My main issue with this app right now is the event popups. No one wants to get a popup every time they finish an episode. There should be a way to turn those off (if there is, it\u2019s not obvious). It completely kills the reading experience.","1237":"WEBTOON gives me something to look forward to every single day. So much effort is put in to providing the comics all of the artists make and each is a complete roller coaster of emotions! A bonus is that this app is the only reason I know what day of the week it is\ud83d\ude02 (depending on what day certain comics update). If you need an emotional upper or something to relieve boredom (which I often do), Webtoon will always provide:)","1238":"Been using this app for about a year now and I like how it runs. I only have to problems both somewhat minor. You have to reload the app if you turn your phone screen off for an extended amount of time. Also I\u2019ve been getting not only pop up ads while using that refuse to stop showing. That and the regular ads are easily opened, I did not want to get redirected to some website because I accidentally tapped the ad button.","1239":"I love love love webtoon and it\u2019s my favorite app but only major problem is daily pass and I get they need to earn money. But I really want to finish true beauty because it\u2019s like the best story I\u2019ve ever seen. I just can\u2019t wait 7days to read one episode... please by any chance webtoon could take the daily pass out.\nEvery reader\/user that have webtoon probably think the same with me. Or at least give some people 20coins for free everyday :(","1240":"I like this app you get tot see many stories here but the sucky thing is mobile users can\u2019t upload there own comics, because mobile users are mostly focused as the readers, but I believe that should change because I wanted to make my own comics because I finally had gotten an iPad with an Apple Pencil, but it turns out I can\u2019t upload it unless I have a desktop I hope this option will change in the future. :(","1241":"This used to be the best app, but now with these daily passes you have to read for months to finish a story which is horrible, then the pass only last 14 days so if you wanna go back to an old story you cannot. You have to pay to read it again. This makes the app unappealing. I hate wait every day for one episode especially when there\u2019s over 100 episodes in the story. They need to stop with this daily pass nonsense because it has truly ruined to entire app.","1242":"It was working fine yesterday but then I come on to the app today and it doesn\u2019t work\nI don\u2019t know why like when I try to real log back it is says my account doesn\u2019t exist and I don\u2019t really want to make a new account \nThis is really annoying and please help me out. Like y\u2019all really need to fix this cuz I\u2019m kind of annoyed \nThat\u2019s why I am giving it only a 3 star rating \nSomeone help me out and I know everything is right when I log in trust me but it still doesn\u2019t work","1243":"I really enjoy webtoon. It is a great app. There is one major problem. The new canvas add reward feature never works for me, and I\u2019m sure many others can say the same. Even with the new added instructions to reset the advertising identifier, it still will not work after I have done this. The add will not load every time I try. Webtoon, if you can, please try to get this fixed ASAP!","1244":"Ok so first of all... I. LOVE. WEBTOON. My obsession is crazy. This is the best app ever. The variety of comics is amazinggggg! My only problem is that I was reading a webtoon and the app randomly crashed. I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but, yeah... Now, if I go to open the app, it crashes automatically. I\u2019ve done everything to fix this. Re - downloaded, Restarted my device, etc. I\u2019m so sad because I can no longer get my daily dose of webtoon. Please help me! UwU","1245":"I LOVE everything about the app but not the ad rewards. When I click on the eps. and I try to watch the ad to read my reward. It says  something like \u201cunable to load ad\u201d and then I couldn\u2019t read my darn eps. :( So IDK what to doo..HELP..I am quite happy that some comics have ads and some don\u2019t cause I would still have something to read. Still a 5\/5 tho.","1246":"I have had Webtoons installed for a few years now and I rarely had any issues. Ever since this recent update, the app itself have been acting funky. It doesn\u2019t load all the way sometimes and it freezes. I can\u2019t see my stories and when it \u201cloads\u201d it freezes. At first thought it was connection, but it wasn\u2019t because I went on Tapas, that app was working just fine. Please fix! I love this app and it\u2019s awesome and a great escape!","1247":"I love WEBTOON and I\u2019ve been reading comings on it for 2.5 years. The one thing that drives me crazy is that when I get a new phone\/I have to delete the app for any reason (like yesterday when I had to restore my phone after a software bug), it doesn\u2019t save my bookmarks. Even though I have an account, all of my bookmarks are gone when I log back in. Some comics I\u2019m not caught up on so I have NO idea what I last read.","1248":"So when I reset my old dad\u2019s phone I was 10 and now I\u2019m 11. The only reason I got this app was because of the story True Beauty. Later I found the story Not Even Bones. I finished the thing in two nights but on the night I finished I would NOT go to sleep. I didn\u2019t sleep until two in the morning. I was shaking like crazy, my heart was even beating two times faster just because of the thought people could have went through this in real life. On top of that, it used very bad language and is not recommended for a child that\u2019s at least under 17+. Yet the age limit is 12 and I am 11, I would expect better. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udca9","1249":"I LOVE this app and the stories I\u2019ve found on it..however, when I went to make an account I never received the verification Email.. at first I blamed myself, thinking maybe somehow I typed it in wrong but when I proof checked it and tried to use a completely different email the same thing happened! This is ridiculous and I\u2019d appreciate if this bug or whatever is fixed because the website and app are both giving the same issues and making it a little hard for me to enjoy this platform to the full extent.","1250":"I\u2019ve used this app for about 3 years and currently I\u2019ve been having a little issue. Whenever I go on the app or click a webtoon it says that it\u2019s having trouble with the internet connection, even when I\u2019m using WiFi. I also have 4g so when I\u2019m not using WiFi I don\u2019t understand what the problem is... overall I love this app and it\u2019s a great app for people who love comics or reading.","1251":"I\u2019ve used the app daily for around two years, and I completely understand that they want to make more money... daily passes? Really? I don\u2019t mind fast pass, but to not be able to read more than one episode a day on certain series is NOT a change I\u2019m looking forward too. Also, authors should be able to include the content they want without having to worry about keeping it too PG - increase the age limit on the App Store if you have to. I\u2019m concerned for the future of this app.","1252":"I was a little skeptical at first, because I was like, these comics MUST have some sort of \u2018premium\u2019 or pay feature, but it\u2019s all completely free!! There are some very talented artists who do webtoon, and i find myself addicted to their stories!! No ads or anything while I\u2019m reading! It\u2019s honestly amazing! Totally worth it. And completely free as well! Great job on this app. (I would recommend reading sirens lament as well!)","1253":"I love this app amazing and I want to see more from it but at the moment there is a bug where as soon as a open a WEBTOON and I let go of a the page it doesn\u2019t let me continue and I\u2019ve restarted the app many times I think this is a bug the developers want to look into. I hope this is temporary because I love to use your app and I spend most of my morning on it while I\u2019m in the car (I\u2019m a high schooler so don\u2019t worry about that part)","1254":"This app is something that saved my life. It is so relatable and cheers me up everyday. The stories hook me, especially Gourmet Hound and Acception, yes...I love dramas and food...but there\u2019s one tiny thing. Sometimes, it takes so long to load the comic. All that shows up is something checkered, black and white. And I have so sometimes wait ten minutes for it to show up. But other than that, the app\u2019s great!","1255":"Webtoon is great. It allows the user to access hundreds of great comics. Today i went on to check my comics im subscrived to and clicked on one only to get logged out? When i tried to log back in but it said my email doesent exist on their site. I tried my school, personal, and business email all to get the same result. I tried every password i used and still nothing. Ive seen this bug happen with other people too.","1256":"I LOVE webtoon! Ah it\u2019s just so great, the art, the authors and everything! Don\u2019t get me wrong I love it but since the new policy came up about mature content, I think it\u2019s affected many authors who solely do mature content that\u2019s part of their story. I feel like it shouldn\u2019t be a new policy seeing as how it\u2019s affecting the authors and their stories in general. That\u2019s all that I\u2019d have to say that I don\u2019t like about it other than that everything is great!","1257":"This app is great and I love it so much often times I will have a bad day and read a funny webtoon or if I\u2019m bored I\u2019ll just read and the stories are amazing. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ll read about 3 episodes than if freezes and I have to close the app and than go back to it. Also I would like to know how to make webtoon a because I can\u2019t figure it out and when I try it doesn\u2019t work. The app is great mostly but it keeps breaking and it just takes up too much of my time to fix it.","1258":"I love WEBTOON sooooo much.I actually read on it everyday. The comics are so amazing,creative,and addictive. I can\u2019t get enough of it. I would totally recommend this app if you love comics or just reading. Or even if you don\u2019t like reading there are some comics that don\u2019t have a lot of words in each update. Get WEBTOON and try it out if you end up not liking it you can always delete it. I just love WEBTOON and think it\u2019s an amazing app. \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0b","1259":"I love webtoon. I always use it if my favorite stories is free on there.\nBut Recently, Webtoon has been logging me out. Making me have to log in again. This would\u2019ve been fine if it happened once, but it has happened three times. And it\u2019s getting annoying (hence the title.) So please fix this problem. This would be five stars, but that problem costed one star. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great app.","1260":"I have never been into comics but I love how I can personalize and choose only what I want to read. It\u2019s also cool that you can view less popular stories as well and there is always something to read. \n\nI do wish they would bring back the tap to scroll option they had when I first downloaded the app. \nThat would be more than deserving of 5 stars!\nIs there any way WEBTOON can bring the tap to scroll option back?","1261":"This is honestly the best app ever!! The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is how we have to pay for fast passes just to read an episode that is already out, come on Webtoon you\u2019re better than that!! But, I do like how we can eventually read the episodes without having to pay for them, I\u2019m just impatient. I would give this app 10 stars if it were possible!!","1262":"Honestly I\u2019m only keeping this app for 2 comics other than that I used to always review old and finished comics but now there\u2019s a daily pass that makes it where you can only go through a single chapter a day and now they are beginning to be like the other apps that force you to pay stuff non stop, before you could just choose to pay since you would usually only have to wait a week so it wasn\u2019t bad but now I can\u2019t binge anything so it\u2019s really boring","1263":"I love this app! It gives you an infinite amount of comics to read that seem to never end. It\u2019s so addicting! The second I finish reading one webtoon, I immediately start reading another! In a way it\u2019s just more torture for me because I have to wait a whole week for a new episode of more and more webtoons and endure even more cliffhangers, but it\u2019s totally worth it! I love this SOOOOO MUCH! It\u2019s just too amazing.","1264":"Recently the app has been going slow and not loading stories. I thought it was my phone at first and deleted things and even uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. I even restarted my device. But it\u2019s not working. It could be my internet connection but I doubt it. This all started to happen after the last 2 most recent updates. Before this o loved the app. That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it a high rating but because of this problem I can\u2019t enjoy my stories.","1265":"They let you read about halfway through a comic, running ads the whole time, then start requiring you to either pay 50 cents a page, or wait a full day to read the next page. I\u2019d MUCH rather watch more ads, and be able to read the full comic for free. That being said, there are some very nice comics on here","1266":"I love this app! A lot of the comics are very addictive and very interesting! However, this new \u201dFast Pass\u201d thing HAS TO STOP!! People no longer discuss the comics and only complain that they have to wait longer, because they willingly paid to read ahead. It\u2019s really annoying. There are a lot of authors who have Patreon so why do they also need Fast Pass too? They don\u2019t! Please get rid of the fat pass very soon, like by the end of February. That would be wonderful!","1267":"I really liked the app at first but I wanted to have a account so I went to type my email and the other information in the sign up box and submitted it.. It just went back to the email box so I double checked if I missed spelled it and I didn\u2019t.. so I tried two other emails both were not missed spelled and both did not work either and it\u2019s kinda of annoying.. I really hope they can help me on this because I did not see it in there helping site to login.","1268":"This is one of my favorite games!\nIf you are new this is helpful for your app experience..\nAll you have to do is do a little survey and then log in a account with email or google account. Then you start picking a story you want to read. This may confuse you but u slide down to go more into the story. \n\nThis developer is amazing since it\u2019s pride month for me I\u2019m reading just humans.. it is amazing!!!","1269":"I\u2019m not going to lie.  I love webtoon.  The community here is beautiful (well, most of it anyway) the creators are amazing, the readers are respectful (again, most of them) the art is beautiful, and so are the stories.  But I\u2019m not a huge fan of this NSFW update.  If it\u2019s not child appropriate then put age restrictions on certain webcomics.  Don\u2019t ban them.  It\u2019s like giving someone a chance to be creative, then throwing away their picture because you disapprove.  Their are other ways to deal with NSFW content.  Your current solution isn\u2019t gonna work for me.","1270":"WEBTOON is a great app where hundreds of comics can be found. Most comics are great and interesting... but the one thing this app has that I very much dislike is it\u2019s chapters. When you get a new phone and you have had webtoon and read it\u2019s stories the stories you read don\u2019t show what chapters you have read, leaving you clueless as to where you left off. Can there be a change please... many would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","1271":"I would glad to give five star if webtoon has a dark mode feature\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb please make it happen because I love to read webtoon after a long day while lying down in my bed! and of course i turn off the lamp... and turn on the dark mode in my phone... however everytime i open the webtoon app.. it\u2019s too bright and it hurts my eye :( please consider the dark mode feature\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude2d please i\u2019m begging you.. my eyes hurt right now. thank you so much\ud83e\udd70","1272":"I love WEBTOON because of how authors work really hard to create new WEBTOONS Also we can make more WEBTOON by our selves I am so happy to have a amazing app as this I love the genres in WEBTOON I love everything in this app This APP IS THE BEST APP EVER It also helped me grow with my reading skills I am so happy My teacher was proud of me too I learned many things from this app I am a big fan of it I bet everyone will love this but I Well WE don\u2019t like the NEW POLICY\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d","1273":"I\u2019ve been using it daily for a few years now and I\u2019ve never had any problems. I\u2019m not usually a fast passer so I can\u2019t speak much about that but the comics are incredible and I love the layout of the app. I had actually used another web comic app in the past and I found the layout confusing. I appreciate WEBTOON for the artists it brings and how easy it is to use.","1274":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for about three years now and the only thing I can ask of the creators of WEBTOON is that can they possibly add a like all eps so that no one has to go back to all the episodes that they didn\u2019t heart to just scroll up to the top page and click like all? It would be a pleasure to have that done!\nKind regards to the creators of all the amazing art work and the creators! (*\u00b4\ua4b3`*)","1275":"I love Webtoon! you can read anything from any genre and from any art style! I love what the authors draw and they make these characters really come to life. Ive had this app for about two years now, and I have absolutely fallen IN LOVE with these stories. I absolutely love almost all the stories and will definitely continue to read more. My absolute favorite is Noblesse, I can\u2019t think of anything better!","1276":"I really love this app! It\u2019s great and it helps spend a lot of free time and you can see people talent. But I have one big problem. The ads. Normally I\u2019m fine with the ads but it\u2019s to the point where they just won\u2019t load in. My internet is perfectly fine but every time I go to watch a ad to see the next episode(s) and I click to watch a ad it just gives me a error. I\u2019ve tried waiting and coming back, it\u2019s been a week and I still can\u2019t read the episode","1277":"Every thing was fine with this app but now the buttons don\u2019t even work! I could still click the comic to read but once it\u2019s clicked I can\u2019t even see the the number of episodes,  the whole thing goes blank! I couldn\u2019t even read my favorite webtoon because of this. I thought something was wrong with my phone and also reinstalled it like twice and it\u2019s still the same!!! Please fix this soon. This app is like my favorite, I read the webtoon everyday.","1278":"Recently, when I try to read a WEBTOON that updated not too long ago the page where you can choose which chapter to read and it will not load. I\u2019ve restarted my phone, I\u2019ve checked my WiFi many times, and closed out WEBTOON many times as well.  I also re-opened the page where you can choose which chapter to read many times. I really love this app and in order for me to keep reading the webtoons I love and enjoy this has to be fixed.","1279":"Omg there are so much romance and there is emotion in the stories of your ready to get emotional then I say read it ! I almost cried in one of the books there is beautiful art that inspires me . I definitely recommend you to get this app I read 12 hours on WEBTOON! There is also comedy that makes  you laugh so hard lol! If your ready to read books that touches your heart then read it!!!! Please!!!","1280":"Something I've noticed for the past few days is that when there's music on an ep, it'll play for a few seconds and then cut out, or sometimes it won't even play at all. I've tried just about everything I can think off and it still doesn't work. It's not a huge deal but the music adds a certain atmosphere that I think is lessened by the lack of it. \n\nOther than that, the app is perfect.","1281":"It\u2019s an amazing app you can come here and read so many stories and comics that you will adore!! I only have one request....why don\u2019t you have Dark mode? Like I enjoy that it\u2019s white but sometimes I read at night in my dark room and the whiteness of the menu and everything is BLEACH to my eyes can you pls add dark mode for all of my nocturnal friends? If you read this thank you for your time!","1282":"It\u2019s the same as the website, except it has fast pass and coins and a \u201cdownload\u201d feature. Wow, I can view my series offline?! No. You only can download the newest episode, and for 30 days. But the app promotes spending money for coins to buy a fast pass (episode ahead of time before update) because you can\u2019t do the events all the time for a small amount of coins . Guess what! You can\u2019t readily make a webtoon, because of what\u2019s required. This is NOT a simple entertainment system, and it\u2019s only online. It\u2019s better to stay on the website.","1283":"Really good, I LOVE this app. I started reading webtoons last summer and this is now my favorite app. However, one thing I would like the creators to fix is that there was an event to get coins and I was supposed to get one today and I didn\u2019t. They said that I was supposed to get the coins by the end of today. I hope the creators can fix this. My sister and I both had this problem. Thank you!!","1284":"I\u2019ve had this app for awhile now and their stories THE. BOMB! Who ever is reading this and thinking hmm should I get this app?YES! I always tell my friends to get this app. Even my friends that say well I don\u2019t even like reading I have been able to get them hooked on this app. It\u2019s free unless you want to read ahead. I don\u2019t think I can say anything bad about this app it\u2019s just so cool!!\ud83d\ude01","1285":"I use this app and it\u2019s one of my favorites and it\u2019s overall really good. The only thing I have to say is that every time I\u2019m connected to my WiFi or on my data, the app will say there\u2019s a network error when my network is fine. If I delete the app then all my data will be deleted so that\u2019s out of question. Please see if anything is wrong.","1286":"The app itself works just fine, but for some reason it won\u2019t let me log into my account. I made 100% sure that I have the right password and all (I can log in just fine through all of my browsers on all devices,) but it just won\u2019t work on the app. Every time I try, it just says \u201cunable to load information, please retry or try again later.\u201d This has been going on for a couple of weeks now, I\u2019ve tried on both my iPad and my phone...","1287":"When I first saw this app I had my doubts since I was never much of a reader and a picky person but once I got the app I completely fell in love with some of the stories like lore Olympus and castle swimmer. This app kept me interested and has something for everyone. Best of all it\u2019s free the only thing that costs money is when you want to see the next episode before it actually comes out","1288":"I really love the comics. They are so much fun to read and the music puts a whole new twist on things. It\u2019s super enjoyable! But for some reason whenever I hit the bottom of the episode, a loading icon erratically pops up and then an ad pulls me out of webtoon and into safari. It\u2019s really annoying, and sometimes the sound will even glitch to start playing the ad at the bottom. Please fix!! It\u2019s definetly disturbing the experience and makes it hard to read.","1289":"I\u2019ve had this app for a few months and it\u2019s amazing! My only issue is that starting about 2 months ago, I would be reading a comic and all of a sudden I\u2019ll be redirected to one of those spam safari \u201cyou\u2019ve won a prize!\u201d pages. I\u2019ve run virus scan on my phone, nothing\u2019s been found, and this issue only occurs on this app. It hasn\u2019t caused any damage, but very annoying. Otherwise an amazing app!!","1290":"I LOVE WEBTOON there\u2019s AMAZING comics so many nice people and such but my only problem is the random audio ads. I get that they need the ads to keep the app free but the random audio ads are annoying, (not to mention scary when they play out of no where) they play out of no where and sometimes when you exit the webtoon you\u2019re ready the ad doesn\u2019t stop which is the most annoying thing ever. But overall the app is amazing and 100% free and 110% amazing.","1291":"let me just start off by saying i LOVE webtoon. it\u2019s a great platform for authors to publish their work and for readers to enjoy it. i\u2019ve discovered countless amazing authors with beautiful artwork and stories. HOWEVER, the new policy isn\u2019t fair to the authors! they should be able to portray their stories in the way they want without limitations on more mature content. if anything, they should create a system where younger viewers cannot access it. but instead the creativity and potential vision of many stories is being compromised which isn\u2019t fair. please fix this webtoon!","1292":"The new 2018 policy is awful. So many of my favorite authors are having to take down their amazing work because of the policy. The stories i wait all night for...gone. This will be putting me in a state of depression because i am very sensitive and Webtoon was one of the only places i could go to read amazing comics to feel happy. The policy is taking away more than half of that needed happiness. Please, change it back. We beg of you... I had a 5 star rating for this before. Now it isnt because my happiness is being taken away and authors' happiness and life work are being taken away too. Webtoon, i hope your happy.","1293":"I love WEBTOON and all but with the new policy, its running all of my favorite comics. Their a reason people put up NSFW warnings before you start to read. And because of this new policy a lot of people are moving their comics to Tapas. I think WEBTOON should create a little section for NSFW content, where children under the age can\u2019t read it. This might or might not make things better, but I would rather do this then to kick many comics out just because some children can\u2019t deal with stuff like that.","1294":"I loved Webtoons and all the creativity on it, I still do. But as you know, the new policy of inappropriate content on Webtoons not being aloud or even accepted censored. I do not agree with this new rule, it is currently forcing lots of Webtoon creators to leave the cite. I\u2019ve noticed this because lots of my favorite Webtoons have either left or being forced to change their amazing comics. I find this unfair and discouraging. Webtoons has taken away the freedom and creativity Webtoon creators have. I feel that Webtoons should rethink their unfair decision for this new policy.","1295":"I absolutely love this app so much that I made my gf download it over reading her comics online. This scratches my itch for more comics that may be outside of the manga style. The UI is smooth, and I never experience glitches. My only issue with it is that if you are playing music from your phone, the ad at the end of a chapter will disrupt the music. Don\u2019t disrupt my music. Other than that, app is fabulous.","1296":"To be honest NOTTING is wrong it\u2019s definitely amazing!! So far my favorite one is \u201cFREAKING LOVE\u201d oh god it\u2019s just soo good lol! Anyway. Reason why I made the tittle \u201csomething is just annoying.\u201d Is because then basically are all done with the series *i think* but I hate how it comes to the end when things are just getting good, they do let you read for free but- you have to wait! And I HATE waiting lol- mostly 3-10 days. Everything else is AMAZING tho! GO WEBTOON! :D","1297":"I\u2019ve noticed recently (as in this year) most coin events give out 3 coins when most chapters cost 5 coins. If you want to unlock using an event now you have to buy coins and may still end up unable to unlock new chapters. Only older series cost 3 coins. I hope this isn\u2019t Webtoon starting a descent into becoming money hungry, coin dependent like some other apps I\u2019ve seen. I know they need to make money somehow but the 5 coin events before were well and good. Why change it","1298":"ok so i\u2019m going to start off by saying that i think webtoons a great app. BUT i hate that ur buying wattpad and making them remove their smut\/inappropriate content. that\u2019s like taking the wattpad out of wattpad, and wattpad will lose millions of users. you can\u2019t just make another app get rid of its content (THAT ITS KNOWN FOR). wattpad is an escape for me, and by making it kid friendly you\u2019re just losing loyal users (also, wattpads a 17+ app, so why should you make it kid friendly???). my suggestion to you is to just make a WattpadKids app where things will be heavily censored instead of ruining wattpad for everyone.","1299":"There was this 5-day check in challenge for this webtoon called Omniscient Reader that I absolutely love. It promised 5 coins for free if I checked in on time for 5 days straight. I managed to complete the challenge and clicked redeem. It said I had to update the app to be able to receive coins properly so I did. Now, every time I try to redeem my coins the app crashes. I\u2019ve been trying for an hour now and I feel cheated out of the prize I won for completing the challenge. Please fix this bug so I can redeem my coins, I checked my account and it STILL says 0 coins.","1300":"It is honestly a great app to read different stories. Something that makes a little off of 5 stars is that sometimes the ads won\u2019t play even when I click it multiple times, I am connected to WiFi and the internet overall but it doesn\u2019t work. I have refreshed it many times and closes the app and opened it again. Overall the app has very kind people who make amazing stories.","1301":"I love all the different variety of comics but what annoys me is how they added daily pass to completed comics. A few days ago, I was going to read a comic I\u2019ve been saving up for but then I saw that there was daily pass. I get that it\u2019s to help authors earn money but doing this makes me not want to use the app anymore. Instead of being to read the full comic in just a few days, I need to wait for so long to unlock more episodes. New users in WEBTOON won\u2019t be able to fully experience the comic because of this. I hate it.","1302":"I hate that you have to buy freaking coins to continue watching them i demand you take it off you give us a good little story and make us so interested in them and after awhile you make us pay for coins to continue and us getting interested in the little story is pushing us to have nee for more which makes us buy coins it\u2019s freaking stupid I am not changing my review or star rating until you take it off the app so we don\u2019t have to pay for stupid coins just make it to we\u2019re we can watch videos to earn coins","1303":"I really love this app, and I've had it for years. However, with the new \"watch an ad to view an episode\" thing is unnecessary. I just want to read my webtoon and be on with my day. This app is turning into those games where you have to watch an add every time you die. There are plenty of ads around the world and I liked webtoon because it didn't demand ads to see each episode. I'm starting to dislike it because I have to watch an ad for each episode I want to see.","1304":"It used to be the only free comics app, but they added coins where you can buy ahead. It was kind of annoying because other people could get top comment, but not that bad. But now, to read the finished WEBTOONS you have to use passes which last only for two weeks, and then you have to buy them. You used to be able to read it unlimited times for free. I get they need money, but this ruined the only free comics app.","1305":"I\u2019ve had webtoon for a couple of years now and it has given me no problems. Starting from yesterday the app took forever to open up. My WiFi is good, my phone is fine and nothing is wrong. The app would open up after forever but for some reason I can\u2019t access my subscribed webtoons. It just keeps me on the recents tab and I can\u2019t go anywhere else. Even when I tap on one it takes 10 years to open up but then it\u2019s just white. Nothing is loading. I\u2019m very disappointed in what once was a near perfect app.","1306":"I went into webtoon as usual but it kept saying that it needed to be connected to the WiFi but I was connected! So I deleted the app and reinstalled it and I login into my old account again and all of my subscribed comics were there but webtoon has this thing where if you relogin into you old account it WON\u2019T KEEP TRACK OF WHICH EPISODE YOU WERE ON ON EACH COMIC! I hope webtoon fixes these problems but the WiFi may have been just my fault not sure.","1307":"No complaints besides the TC system. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I LOVE the app! But the Top Comment system just seems like a way to urge people to read more comics(and that way, have a higher chance of getting tc)  People get so obese over TC; it\u2019s ridiculous. This is a cheap way to get readers obsessed and getting more people to read more comics.  It gets to the point where people dislike comments and hate on others and bully and discourage others just to get TC!!!  This needs to be stopped tbh","1308":"So we\u2019re having to pay to read now? The app was amazing. It was awesome being able to read without having to worry about tickets or coins anytime we wanted to read a story but now that changed. Why? It\u2019s incredibly disappointing to see and the app is becoming just like every other app nowadays. More and more companies are selling out and only looking at the money. Webtoons has a good community going and selling out will only damage it. It was a great app and a great place to read but honestly it is disheartening to see a change like this.","1309":"I\u2019ve been using this app for about 3 years and I haven\u2019t complained at all. Sometimes it takes a while to load, but what app doesn\u2019t? You should definitely get it if you\u2019re into comics because they\u2019re free and amazing. If you\u2019re into making comics you can also put it on discover if you\u2019re 14. This app hasn\u2019t let me down at all. It even makes Monday\u2019s enjoyable","1310":"I love this app so much I enjoy reading all the different webtoon comics but recently my app kept saying it couldn\u2019t connect to the internet. I tried everything from resetting my phone to updating my phone and the app and nothing worked! I had no other option but to delete the app and re-download it. I logged in to my account ready to read but all my webtoons were gone! I have to look for them all over again and find where I left off on each one, not fun.\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude22","1311":"I love this app and it helps me pass the time and I love all the story\u2019s and art it\u2019s an amazing app but I do hate the new update where you have to pay to read the other episodes it cost 5 coins witch you have to buy with real money please read and don\u2019t ignore I\u2019m supper upset and disappointed with the new changes it might just be me but I have to at least say something I\u2019m not trying to shame or bring the app down I love this app I just wish it would take the money coin thing out of it","1312":"I really enjoyed webtoon a lot allowing creators to share the art and stories I love a lot of webtoons and being able to pick from so many. But recently they added a new policy limiting creators of being able to do certain things that are very crucial to some stories, and not letting them promote their own work this is very saddening to hear because some creators have thought to stop posting on webtoon which I cannot stand. Hopefully they fix this and this doesn\u2019t last longer.","1313":"Recently it logged me out for no reason??? And when I tried to log back in it said it didn\u2019t recognize my email and after a few days of repetitively putting in all of my emails I decided to just make a new account. It\u2019s really infuriating though because I was subscribed to probably hundreds of webtoons, most of which were discover. Please try to fix this problem, it happened to my friend too.","1314":"I\u2019m not sure where else to put this so I\u2019m just going to include it in my review. To whoever chooses what WEBTOON advertises.\n\nSTOP PUTTING OUT ADS FOR ROMANCES\n\nI have not seen a single advertisement for this app that has not featured a romance comic. This includes the comic that made me download the app (which was misleading because it didn\u2019t appear to be a romance). I know for a fact this app has plenty of great comics that are not romances. There is no reason they should be the only ones they advertise.\n\nAside from that, it\u2019s a pretty great app. I don\u2019t have issues with how it runs and it definitely has some amazing comics. Advertisements just frustrate me because they usually get my hopes up by proposing an interesting concept and then ruin it for me by revealing it was a romance all along, and I really dislike romances. Bright side, this app is apparently for you if you like romances!","1315":"I love WEBTOON!!! My favorite book is \u201cCursed Princess Club\u201d. Though I love the book a lot that that I finished the episodes but then  a new one came up! I was excited to read it but then it said I needed coins and if I didn\u2019t have coins I have to wait. I told myself \u201coki I can wait\u201d BUT I CANNOT WAIT!!! TwT!!! I highly suggest to take the coins and the waiting away. Oki I hope you respond to me. :D","1316":"i opened webtoon one day and it made me sign in. it said i had more then one device connected which i don\u2019t, and even after i signed in it deleted everything except my read history. all my comments subscriptions likes and coins got deleted. it made me mad because i\u2019ve had the app for a while and i had a lot of good things i was subscribed to but now i won\u2019t be able to find them. i like the app but it is so irritating, especially since i didn\u2019t even HAVE a second device signed on.","1317":"Hi so basically I LOVE WEBTOONS!! There\u2019s one thing i think would be really useful and I hope u read this. When I really like a webtoon. For example \u201cRemarried Empress\u201d I really want to find one that\u2019s similar to it. So i propose and section in the webtoon where it shows webtoons that are like the one i\u2019m reading. So like in netflix where it shows which shows or movies are similar to the one that you\u2019re watching. THANK YOU I LOVE WEBTOONS","1318":"I\u2019m very disappointed in the new update. They finally made so if I was in horizontal\/ landscape\/ whatever you call it orientation when I went to the next comic it would stay that way. Newest update ruined it! Also, I would really like it if there were a way to make sure certain types of comics aren\u2019t recommended. Definitely including the comics I\u2019m already subscribed to -_-  please put more time into the stream lining the algorithm for ease of use.","1319":"Just found out after 4 weeks of not having access to my purchased coins that I was \u201cnever logged into an account\u201d and if I want my money back I have to go though the App Store. So for the past year I\u2019ve been buying coins, posting comments and I even changed my nickname. Not once did anything prompt me to login. All my unlocked chapters are gone. All my new subscriptions are gone. So I\u2019m calling bs to the response that I was \u201cnever logged in.\u201d There is no way to post a comment or subscribe to comics unless logged in. Thanks for wasting my time customer service ai.","1320":"I really like this app mainly because so many of the creators here are super good. But I have recently been reading completed webcomics and halfway through reading they suddenly become daily pass ones and I takes forever to get through them. I don\u2019t like this ofc. I just wish there was another way the creators could make money off their completed comics without upsetting readers.","1321":"I really like this app, it\u2019s fun and helps pass time, but recently they added this new feature where to read finished story\u2019s you need to wait a day or pay, which is bs because those Webtoons are already done and most people want something else to read while they wait for other webtoons to upload, I\u2019m worried that webtoon is going to try to make you pay money in the future just to read at all.","1322":"I really do like Webtoon, \nBut there are also things that I don\u2019t like about it. The biggest thing I hate about it is the new Daily Pass that is put onto completed stories. All I wanted to do was re-read Super Secret then all of a sudden I\u2019m limited to reading one episode per day. I don\u2019t know why it was decided to add Daily Pass but I and other users are pretty upset\/outraged by it. Especially since re-reading stories is my favorite pass time. \n\nWebtoon was fine without the daily passes.","1323":"This app is wonderful but fast pass. It makes me wait a whole 2 week or even a month to read the story again. I know that app requires coins\/money but the least you can do is make us wait a week not 2 flipping months. Also if you want less fast passes you should read Lumine it only has 1 fast pass at 109 or sooner it depends when you read it. But other than that this is an amazing app","1324":"Okay why the hell did all my reviews get deleted. Now I have to write a review, again. :\/ Screw Apple for deleting my reviews.\n\nSince Daily Pass exists guess I\u2019ll just find a website that reposts the old Webtoons. I\u2019m too poor and don\u2019t have time to wait another day to read my Webtoons. Love the Canvas reward ad feature though. Wouldn\u2019t mind watching a few ads to read it. But alas, guess you want me to not read it. \n\nEdit: They also have been doing rebate offers CONSECUTIVELY for the past 2 months. How hungry for money can you get?! Looks like free coins don\u2019t exist, anymore. Just buy one get 1 free offers.","1325":"Overall, WEBTOON is great, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of nice things come out of it. My only actual issue is that it is extremely annoying to try to find comics you\u2019re reading that have new posts if they are in the list of comics you have read. I just want the \u2018up\u2019 notification that appears on the main page on the \u2018my comics\u2019 list.","1326":"I think this app has some amazing qualities about it, the authors and stories are incredible! However, instead of having to wait multiple days to read a chapter or pay for it, I would recommend allowing the player to watch a couple short adds. Also, I have WiFi but it says there\u2019s a connection problem and other apps are working perfectly fine","1327":"I\u2019m truly OBSESSED with Webtoons!! I\u2019m a full time student who works 15-20 hours a week and when I finally get some downtime I LOVE reading webtoons! Their romance section got me hooked!! Not only is does the story have you on edge waiting for the following weeks episode, but the artwork is just phenomenal! Highly recommend if you love reading webtoons! Plus they have many different genres, I just prefer romance and drama!","1328":"There are so many comics for all type of people. If your looking to laugh a lot, your in luck because they plenty of comedy. If you want some romance, they have that too. I\u2019m a 13 year old girl, but yet my 29 year old brother is on it too. If your into romance I would recommend: let\u2019s play, I love yoo, LUFF, and reflection of the soul. The creators of these comics are so funny and creative it\u2019s crazy. Good luck and happy reading!\ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f","1329":"I\u2019m totally okay with the fast pass coin stuff it it supports the writers and it\u2019s not necessary at all since the comics still come out weekly but I found out about daily passes and I could not be more disappointed. I actually switched from another app to WEBTOON  BECAUSE the other app used daily passes and I thought it was such a stupid concept, but I guess greed eventually comes for all apps. Add on top of that the recent update where I take 10 minutes to open the app and Another 5 to even show what comics I subscribe to it\u2019s just really frustrating fix your update and get rid of daily passes","1330":"This app would be great if the WEBTOON Canvas crap or whatever special event promotion would stop popping up while I\u2019m trying to read. I\u2019ve clicked \u201chide info for 7 days\u201d more times than I could count, but it won\u2019t stop, and I can\u2019t seem to find WEBTOON support anywhere to help me fix it. The content and layout is great. But I can\u2019t get into whatever it is I\u2019m reading if the promotions keep interrupting and blocking the webtoon. I couldn\u2019t even participate in the event if I wanted to because the promo pop ups won\u2019t let me read uninterrupted.","1331":"Sooo yeah my reason to remove the fast pass and coins is that most kids don't have money or parents etc and I think your reason is that \"you need money\" or \"this is how our company will not shut down or fall\" I get it just remove it, it will make a lot of smiles on other faces other people may just disagree with it because they bought the coins or fast pass give them like a vip story's etc and be creative about the vip things you may do.","1332":"I love WEBTOON. I use it every day and enjoy all the comics I read but with the recent policy I can\u2019t see a lot of the authors work. The most recent WEBTOON I\u2019ve read had to suggest another app to the readers because they couldn\u2019t display the comic. Like, what if the readers want to see something but have to get a whole other app just to see it and even then what if they can\u2019t get the other app that just ruins the whole experience. But, other than that I love WEBTOON.","1333":"I have used this app for months. It is my nightly ritual to read my favorite comics. Ever since you updated the app, I get a couple hours and then the app loses connection. My internet connection is excellent. All my other apps function properly but not yours. Customer service was not help saying to contact my provider, but they aren\u2019t the issue. Please fix this bug. I have had to delete and re install 3 times and then search for all my comics again. Then I\u2019ll get a day before it does it again.","1334":"So I just adore this app! When I\u2019m bored I go here and read some interesting comics. But one thing, I really don\u2019t want to buy coins to read a new part of the story. And can I just add, I\u2019m pretty impatient, but I could still wait I guess. I hope you add in something else to get coins, instead of paying. For example, maybe put, \u2018watch a video for 5 coins.\u2019 Thank you if you do this!","1335":"Ok so many people have talked about the new policy and how dumb it is, and I agree. I\u2019ve had to watch many creators leave WEBTOON because of the policy, and that makes me very upset, especially since they give warnings. My other problem is that the app no longer works for me. It does nothing but crash nonstop and I can no longer read comics. I used to absolutely love this app and was on it often, but at this point, it\u2019s just a waste of space on my phone. I just tried deleting it and redownloading it, but it\u2019s been so long that I can\u2019t remember my account and have lost all my WEBTOONs. I officially hate this app.","1336":"Well this app is amazing and I read webtoons everyday! And so far I\u2019ve been satisfied from this app! It\u2019s awesome that there are so many creator who are sharing their ideas with others! But there\u2019s just one issue.. It doesn\u2019t let me sign in. I\u2019ve tried many times and it still does not work! I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just me, but it really doesn\u2019t let me!","1337":"I\u2019ve spent so many hours binge-reading comics on here. They\u2019re all completely free, there isn\u2019t any invasive ads, the layout is amazing & there\u2019s so many wonderful artists and stories on here. \nIf you\u2019re a fan of comics of any kind, definitely check this app out! You\u2019ll find yourself addicted to so many comics and checking for updates every day.","1338":"Webtoon has always been a great platform to read webcomics and in the past I thought it was right to have nsfw stuff censored, but with the new policy it changes that. Webtoon creators who spent time and hard work in their comics now have to get rid of some panels in their comic making it shorter, for others it could be entire pages. This isn\u2019t fair to creators and is just hurting their work. Webtoon should go back to their old policy and give the warning they had with comics that have nsfw content in it.","1339":"The app is great and I love all the comics I read! The only problem is... for all the people who like to express their comic for \"things\" have been restricted. They warn you that it is 18+ and older and little children go on and report the comic for bad things. It makes no sense because the artists have put really hard work into the comic but since the policy came around because of CHILDREN who know that it is for older people and they ruin the comic by shutting it down with reports. I really don't like that.","1340":"This app is great for both creators and readers alike. The comics are easy to read from mobile devices as well as online. WEBTOON also has contests that help promote more comics to come and grow (it would be even better if they had competitions more often and different kinds) overall the app is easy to use and great, the only advice I have is that there should be more ways for the great creators on WEBTOON to profit from their hard work.","1341":"I was loving WEBTOON with all its perks and allowances until it wasn\u2019t allowing sexual content. Although it may seem bad that I am upset by this. Sexual content does help stories progress and explain certain conditions in life. Real life is not g rated so why should everything else be. I understand their are minors and all but if they really aren\u2019t allowed to look at that kind of stuff the parents should be involved not the creators. We should not be making the creators suffer due to something the WEBTOON industry has lack to offer. I am very unpleased by how WEBTOON has decided to deal with this. Please and thank you for listening.","1342":"I have had this app for years now and I\u2019ve always enjoyed this app and I still do but I don\u2019t like that we have to pay for the next three episodes because i already wait long enough for the episodes to come out but now I have to wait another 6 days of more to continue a tense story. I wouldn\u2019t mind to watch an ad for the coins but I\u2019m not going to pay anything. I still love this app though","1343":"Lots of good reads and most toons post in time sometimes u get a few writes who have issues so they postpone the toon but I think they should already have a few chapters done already just Incase they need tile to relax but I enjoy the quality and color of the characters and newly added music such a huge jump from old fashioned but still enjoyable shonen and shoujo manga in black and white","1344":"Best app ever. I love love reading all the webtoons while I have downtime at work (I work Graveyard so not much happening) and I love how it shows which ones I missed and what webtoons I can check out based on my personal preference. I have over 50+ webtoons subbed too and I\u2019m in love with each one. Shoutout to MDCBK, UnOrdinary, Lore Olympus, Super Secret, Lumine, Siren\u2019s Lament, I Love Yoo, Ecstasy Hearts, and Oh! Holy for giving me the best ever reading experience and lots of heart felt moments.","1345":"A great webcomics reader. The menu is a little tricky to navigate but that just takes time getting used to. I found the most frustrating thing is even after downloading a comic, some panels won't load. Sometimes, it would be five minutes of waiting for the blank screen to finally pop up with something and that really breaks the flow. Makes downloading at all seem pointless if it still isn't ready to show all of the panels upon opening.","1346":"Iook I love this app am obsessed with it but there isn\u2019t enough romance series and we have to wait for a long time to unlock a new Series\nit\u2019s really annoying, I pice of advice don\u2019t do this waiting to read thing because it won\u2019t get you r great reviews, but I mean who am I to say that am just a girl who love webtoon and cares for this app to grow and grow  and I want it to become very successful","1347":"I spent money on coin and one day it just disappeared with all my history. I wrote to support about a dozen times and each time their reply is something like \u201cdid you use the right email?\u201d \u201cLog out and log in again.\u201d Or \u201cThat should happen.\u201d How is this helpful at all???\n\nThen they ask you to reply if it still doesn\u2019t work. The problem is that YOU CAN\u2019T REPLY to their email so you have to resent another support message and start over and the help goes absolutely nowhere. So I\u2019m out 100 coins and not a single support email was handled. The entire team seems incompetent.","1348":"WEBTOON is a good app, I\u2019m not gonna lie, but it also has a lot of issues. \n1-\nWEBTOON doesn\u2019t do a good job at filtering negative comments.\nI\u2019ve seen thousands of comments on stories with slurs, racism, transphobia, and homophobia,can\u2019t WEBTOON. Doesn\u2019t do anything about it. I once reported a comment, and only three weeks later did the  comment get deleted. \n2- \nmass reported webtoons don\u2019t get taken down. \nI\u2019ve seen a crap ton of comics made by creators who are bad people (racist, etc, etc) I\u2019ve seen thousands of comments on WEBTOONs like that saying that the WEBTOON needs to get taken down, and the webtoons are still up.\n\n3- \nNotifications for webtoons spoil a lot of the story.\nI\u2019ve gotten notifications for stories that spoil the actual plot. It\u2019s very frustrating and makes it hard to like the story if I already know what\u2019s going to happen.","1349":"Love the app been using it for many years now. That being said daily pass infuriates me. I know webtoon  makes enough money that they don\u2019t need that and many readers love rereading old series. As someone who struggles with mental health so severely the old comics are a huge comfort to me and so I find this unfortunate and unfair to us readers, especially bc a good portion of the audience is young enough they don\u2019t have the money to pay. I would give this 5 stars if not for this but it bothers me enough I am giving it 3","1350":"Just recently I was trying to make a new password when all of a sudden it say,\u201dSystem error\u201d im sorry but,wth! I Legit reseted my password and have a total of about six reset passwords. Yet when i go to the password and put in the new password, it says incorrect. EVEN THOUGH I SAVED IT, IT SAYS INCORRECT. So then I try to put a different email, didn\u2019t work. CAUSE IT SAID IT WAS USED! I got two problems. One: Email already used. Two:Password incorrect or already use. I\u2019ve tried everything. Please fix this.","1351":"I love Weston I love how can read comics but I don't like how I have to wait awhile to read a episode and I would you use coins but I don't want to spend anything. I would love if we can get daily coins or at least make the wait on each episode shorter like three days \nBottom line  either make the wait shorter or make daily coins or at least make it easy to make coins with out buying it beside those problems great app","1352":"Amazing app, I just wish that they made daily pass series only be eligible to be daily pass if they are under 100 episodes. it\u2019s impossible to read stories that are longer, even if you want to, since you have to wait. other than that, there are so many stories available and i heavily recommend it.","1353":"I love this app, don\u2019t get me wrong. But recently, I haven\u2019t been able to open any of the stories on the app. I\u2019ve tried restarting, and shutting off my phone, but nothing seems to help. I\u2019m able to open the app. When I click on a story, it shows me a gray page and my screen is frozen. Then, the app closes itself and goes to my home screen. I still receive notifications when a story is uploaded. I\u2019ve been using this app for a while and never had a problem with it before.","1354":"Soo.. i just got on webtoon and NOTHING would load like the whole screen was blank everytime i would click on a story. I got of it and took it off my recently used apps and then i clicked on it again and it still didnt work, i deleted some apps to probably make it faster it still didnt work, i restarted my whole phone it still didnt work, I DELETED THE WHOLE APP AND IT DIDNT LET ME LOG IN\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude24 what do i dooo like im tryibg to readd please fix this\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude23 PS. I got full bar wifi and its not slow. My wifi is fine if you think its my wifi\ud83e\udd75","1355":"This app is my by far my favorite out of all the webcomic apps out there. It\u2019s really easy to navigate and a nice design. There\u2019s lot of diversity in it whether it\u2019s in art style, race, language, etc. Every once in a blue moon it bugs a little but maybe that\u2019s just my internet .. either way it\u2019s an amazing app and i have recommended it to lots of my friends and they have the app too! Luv it <3","1356":"Yes, WEBTOON is a great app and I\u2019ve had it for years but now it just feels like a con for money. You want this? It cost money. You want to see that? It costs money. I understand the coins for the extra episodes but 2 episodes a day on already completed stories you\u2019ve already read.. come on now, that\u2019s ridiculous. That can be changed though, if you pay money \ud83d\ude11","1357":"I love Webtoon !! I love reading the different stories and I could spend hours on it. However, I have to say, introducing such a pathetic way of making money like making it possible to \u201cfast pass\u201d the wait for certain episodes is so infuriating to me. I\u2019d watch ads or something like that if I could get episodes faster, but making people pay extra money to get episodes in advance seems really stupid to me and I\u2019m just very disappointed in the app for that.","1358":"Webtoons is a great app for reading free content and that\u2019s fantastic, but the intrusive ads for their own events really get in the way of reading. It\u2019s happened multiple times, and I don\u2019t want to participate in the event yet there\u2019s no opt out of these annoying pop ups. Who thought that was a good idea? What committee thinks that \u201chey, while the reader is reading a story, let\u2019s put a pop up in the middle, for an event they may or may not participate in!\u201d Please WEBTOONs, I enjoy using your app, but make a way for users to opt in to participate in events!","1359":"Well, i love this app and all, but when i try to sign up it goes straight back to the email address. i'm loving this app so far though! If you love manga too this is the right app for you and almost everything i\u2019ve seen is free which is a huge thing on my part. i just wish i could comment like and subscribe to these amazing people who work so hard to put out great content. thank you for reading this!","1360":"I love WEBTOON it my go to when I\u2019m looking for something to read without being invested for to long depending on if I\u2019m going back to read an update or starting a new comic. The reason I\u2019m giving this 4 stars is because of the new coin system, gone are the day in which everyone has to wait for the start together because some have started using fast pass so getting tops comments are even harder than before.","1361":"WEBTOON comics are the best!!! BUT, I\u2019m sure I and plenty others would appreciate the following upgrades \n- better way to communicate with the writers(enables a way to send pic to them through WEBTOON comments if they choose)\n-Easier way to like the comic episode (I forget to like because the like button is hidden)\n-better sorting method (I\u2019m seeing a lot of the same thing on every page of sorting)\n-gifs too! Not just pictures.","1362":"The whole new policy has really put me off. Most of the audience that uses webtoon are most likely not under 9 years of age. Also the \"You agreed with a comment\" thing is pretty annoying. It makes it difficult to like comments because it pauses the screen while you may be trying to like another comment. \n\nOverall I feel like this new policy is letting Webtoon Publishers to have less of a free space for their stories.","1363":"I loved WEBTOON sooo much... I used to read comics there every single day, until they updated it with the new policy. Now I can\u2019t read the content that I used to enjoy and I hope that they return to the old policy. It has affected many of the comics I read. Webtoon please go back to the old version if you see this. Some authors of comics have worked very hard to get to where they are and now all their work is being thrown away because of the policy. Anyway, there is a warning, and if there are children reading that type of NSFW content that\u2019s their parents fault for not watching what they do.","1364":"I love this app so much and I\u2019ve had it for around two years now all the comics are so cute and just overall amazing but I\u2019m sad to say that this app hasn\u2019t been working properly recently I\u2019ve downloaded some webtoons but it just shows the checkered loading screen I\u2019ve tried everything :( it\u2019s been like this for a couple of days now, it would be great I you could fix it then I\u2019ll give this 5 stars!","1365":"I got into WEBTOON by my friends and even after making completely new friends, they also loved WEBTOON. I loved the freedom of the authors, the diversity in the stories there. You can find a murder mystery and the most adorable couple. It was amazing. I even got into some of the NSFW stuff there. Some of the authors are posting their work on other sites, but usually they require you to pay to access the comics. I liked WEBTOON a lot in the first place because you didn\u2019t have to pay. WEBTOON used to be amazing.","1366":"I have been on their app for awhile just for the BL, and now the new policy restricts the authors use of mature content even if it\u2019s censored, it\u2019s bs\ud83d\ude21. It\u2019s restricting the authors creativity, and not only that but forcing them to leave this platform because of an unfair restriction. It\u2019s not the authors fault that readers who are underage say they are of age and then flag and report the story. I enjoyed this app before the restriction but now I HATE it because all of the stories I read aren\u2019t updating and the authors left. Change this UNFAIR policy.","1367":"I have had line WEBTOON for several years now and it\u2019s a staple part of my life. The WEBTOON dare great quality both artistically and story wise. They are made and edited by professional who have a fixed schedule. They also have a discover section where people can upload their own comics; and if enough people like it and it good stuff, it transfers over to the official selections. Overall, great app \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","1368":"Okay so this is my favorite app and I\u2019ve made so friends download it!! I have absolutely no problems except for one. My ONLY mistake is that I can only subscribe to 100 comics. I find so many great comics and then I can\u2019t subscribe to them bc I\u2019ve subscribed to too many. Please please please fix this. Maybe max can be 200? Please this is my only request. Nothing else than that is wrong with the whole app","1369":"So I love this app it shames me to have to give it one star but it now has this ad for war of the planet of the apes that plays for a bit then stops once you click to exit it it shuts down the app so you can\u2019t read the comic. I\u2019ve deleted the app and reinstall it to see if it fixed the problem but it doesn\u2019t the only I was able to read the comic I wanted to read was to download it but my phone doesn\u2019t have enough memory to do that for the 20 comics I read every week so I hope that it\u2019s fixed soon at that point I\u2019ll change the rating to 5 stars but until then it gets one","1370":"Opening the app, things take a really long time to load. \n\nA lot of the times when I click things, it takes a really long time to actually do the action. It\u2019s really slow. At least show a loading indicator because if I click on something and nothing happens I feel like my app crashed or something (which in reality the app is just taking a long time to load the next page)","1371":"Honestly it\u2019s just a fun app, some stories are not as good as others but the amount of work artists put into it is awesome. The comments after every episode are really fun to read and it\u2019s just a great app to read interesting and creative stories. It literally feels like you are watching a show, get the app to join a loving community filled with comic lovers and anyone in general.","1372":"So iv been using WEBTOON for a couple weeks no and iv had no problems and there are so many different comics too read and if you do get webtoon some of me favorite ones to read that I recommend are Tower Of God, The Gamer, Unordinary, The God Of Highschool and Dragnarok those are the ones I have read so far and in my opinion there amazing and if you just look around you can find more","1373":"I absolutely love Webtoon. I\u2019ve been using the app on and off since 2017. The comics are very entertaining. I\u2019ve just recently gotten back to reading comics on webtoon after a few months of not going on the app at all. I love that I can pay for coins to get to read new episodes faster, but I wish I could watch ads for free coins, or other things like that.","1374":"Love the stories, there are a wide verity of styles, and topics, which a ton of comic apps seem to lack. It has a super nice, accepting, fun community and the app is easy to use, and a huge majority of it is free, but you could also support artist by paying to watch episodes early. Probably the only thing I wished they had was an auto scroll feature, and (this might be to hopeful) a way to get coins by watching adds or something.","1375":"I love this app. I literally used to read something from it every day, the only issue I have is that I had to switch phones and none of my progress saved. I have about 10-15 comics I read daily and stayed up to date on but when I saw I had to go back through and find where I was I just got annoyed with it and stopped reading","1376":"There\u2019s a a lot of links to p#$rn once I was reading the comments for lumine and there were a bunch of links and gross stuff please fix this but other than that THIS APP IS GREAT!!! I love how you guys make us wait for the next episode and trying not to use fast pass but for real please fix this p#$*rn stuff and when someone reports delete this comment there reporting please I\u2019m getting sick of this.","1377":"I love the variety or comics and illustrated stories available, but the reason I\u2019m unable to give 5 stars is for whatever reason, the app keeps freezing up after I click on anything. I\u2019ve never had issues before, and I see it is an issue many users are experiencing, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be resolved? For now I just uninstalled it and will reinstall it again, but that\u2019s only a temporary solution.","1378":"This is one of my most used apps on my phone, so obviously I\u2019m a huge Webtoons fan. But your readers aren\u2019t dumb so please stop treating us like we are? Don\u2019t create a coin wheel where everyone gets one coin...... we can tell it\u2019s rigged and that we were given a false promise to update the app. Don\u2019t put videos on chapters when the videos don\u2019t load\u2014 what do you think will happen to follower retainment this way? Don\u2019t go down the rabbit hole of squeezing $ out of readers. There are other apps on the market that your customers will move to.","1379":"This app is jam packed with amazing stories that span from horror to fantasy and thensome, one comic I\u2019m reading currently is \u201cHardcore Leveling Warrior\u201d and it\u2019s amazingly well crafted, funny, and just saturated with gaming goodness, it\u2019s good that some of the stories are gonna be adapted into anime by crunchyroll as well, perfect fit for people looking for comics that aren\u2019t so mainstream, it\u2019s good to see people use their imaginations to create these dope comics.\n\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udcad\ud83d\uddef","1380":"It is an amazing app with easy to use interface. I haven\u2019t had any real problems until recently when it would freeze after loading a new comic. After force closing the app and opening it again the issue is fixed. Doesn\u2019t happen every time, but enough times to make me write a review about it. Please fix this asap. Again, an amazing app though.","1381":"This app honestly deserves a 5 rating but for some reason it has switched to coins and long waits. Do you guys realize how ridiculous it is to wait 7 days for a new chapter or pay money to unlock it. I understand you need money but just make it ad based so we can at least lower the time . It should be 3-5 hours a wait and then give us the option to watch ads to bring it down to 1 hour. Seriously by the time we wait a week for a new chapter we barely remember what was going on in the story before then.","1382":"Webtoon has brought me so much joy and entertainment just from reading the comics. My only complaint is that sometimes the comments of Fast-Passed episodes come out to just be \"FaSt PaSs SqUaD\" but other than that I honestly have no complains. There's a comic for everyone and binge reading a Webtoon is so fun. I would recommend this to anyone who likes art and good storylines.","1383":"I just got a new phone and downloaded this app again, unfortunately after I logged in I found that all my subscribed stories were gone, also all of my coins that I paid money for were also missing.  There is also no help support for this app so I couldn\u2019t even talk to someone to let them know.  I will probably delete this app if it doesn\u2019t get fixed.  Moral of the story, don\u2019t get a new phone if you want to keep your stuff.","1384":"Im giving this 4-5 stars, because there is still things that need improving to make a 5 star quality app.\n\nFirst of all, I understand that you want this \"Webtoon place\" to be friendly! But you can take off that new policy...\n     \nSecond, why don't you guys make a Mature Selection for mature audiences?\n\nJust a new section for those who are 18+!\n\nThen if their comic did have NSFW Content? Just before they publish a comic, they get the option to select the \"Mature Content\" option! Or if they forgot to, then they can change that later on! \n\nSo in conclusion, this is a Amazing app for comic readers and creators!\nSo LOTS of pros!\n\nVery little Cons, that can easily be fixed!     Cause we all want a community that we all can enjoy together!\n\nBut in the end, just stay awesome!","1385":"I really do enjoy this app, and finding an interest I didn\u2019t know was there. The only thing I wish the app had, was a bit more organization on the \u2018toons we read. I can\u2019t be the only one with a list of subscribes I haven\u2019t ventured into yet. A separate list of ones we are currently reading and one for being interested that we haven\u2019t started.","1386":"WEBTOONs is a great app especially if you want to post your very own work. The app allows you to read and post for free! I mean win win. They have many great artist on here that I\u2019m sure anybody could enjoy. Overall it\u2019s a good app. But....one thing I have to say....is I was there was a better way to get to one artists works. But that\u2019s all so overall the best app for comics ive used. :)","1387":"I would give this app 5 stars but there weren\u2019t a lot of stories that I was interested in. Other than that though I absolutely love this app. At first my sister always was on it and I would occasionally glance over to see but I always thought it was stupid. My sister finally convinced me to give it a try and when I did I fell in love with it. My best friend told me about the story I love yoo (spelled like yoo) and bastard and those are my absolute favorite stories.","1388":"This app would easily become 10x better if we had the option to say that we don\u2019t want certain comics being recommended to us anymore.\n\nI\u2019m exhausted of seeing comics I\u2019ve already tried out being suggested to me, and featured comics shouldn\u2019t really be recommended whenever they\u2019re being showed everywhere you look already.\n\nThe same comics that are featured get recommended to me every day. I can\u2019t remember the last time I subscribed to a recommended comic.","1389":"I personally think it's ridiculous that you would suddenly change policies on authors some of these authors are up to page 200+ after years of posting and one day some CEO woke up and decided that they didn't want some NSFW work. Quite frankly as long as the author puts a warning I don't get the issue. The only reason I still support this app in the slightest is for the few artist who haven't made the switch to a better platform. It's sad to see that a major web comic platform putting down great artists. Sad and the second the last of my comics transfer somewhere better. So will I.","1390":"I really love webtoon. Webtoon is like life for me. I check it everyday and everything but, when webtoon made the new policy for nsfw, I wasn't loving webtoon anymore. As of the basis of my webtoons, I read a lot of nsfw webtoons and I was okay with it being censored, but now, webtoon has taken it to a whole different level and I'm not liking it. So in short, please webtoon bring back the last policy or at least change it so a page can at least be censored and not completely cut off from the entire comic. Thanks.","1391":"I have a week-long trip coming up and with no WiFi or phone, I would like to download webtoons to read while on the go. The problem with downloading them is, they don\u2019t run in the background. That is a big problem, especially if there is more than 100 chapters. I am not a huge fan of staying on one screen and waiting so please make it where I can download and not have to worry about it.","1392":"So one day I randomly downloaded this app because one of my friends had it and she made it sound really nice!! Needless to say, webtoon lived up to my expectations and exceeded it! I love love love reading the stories on there and the art is always amazing whenever I read them. So plz dear people who haven\u2019t downloaded it yet, I suggest you take the time to download it right now :). oh and please read My Dead Cold Blooded King!","1393":"This app is great don\u2019t get me wrong but there used to be a thing we\u2019re if you tapped on the bottom it went down instead of having to swipe. Sometimes I would swipe too much and my finger would hurt that\u2019s why I would love for the tapping on the bottom of the screen to go down thing to come back. That\u2019s my only complaint.","1394":"So I haven\u2019t been on web tune in while and I didn\u2019t know that you had paid to read I had been on for three years which when I went back on I was meeting with paid read those weird coins don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not paying for the thing but I\u2019m still gonna read a comic every day but I guess I just miss the days when you could read for free on your phone and not go to the library.","1395":"WEBTOON is the best comic app I have ever downloaded also it has the best comics I have ever read. People that write these comics are so so so so creative. The app is free as well as the comics which are so so so good. They have weekly updates and everything is free which is one of the best things about the app. There are so many comics and categories you can choose from. I love this app and the comics with amazing plot lines and characters!","1396":"I have read WEBTOON around early 2019 and it was amazing but I take a break and come back there something called daily pass first I thought it was something give you coin but then while I re-read my favorite webtoon call \u201c Refund high-school\u201d I read about 3 daily pass eps and the 4th ep said I have to pay 5 coin to rent it for 14 day. \ud83d\ude30I have see countless people complaining about this I think if WEBTOON remove the daily pass more people will start reading\/ using webtoon.","1397":"I love Webtoon because it lets me explore all the wonderful comics, and i get to read what i like, if your a fan of comics, get this! But some have inspired me to make a comic and publish it on Webtoon,  but the problem is that i don\u2018t have the Money for a computer so i can publish, please Webtoon make a mobile version where i can publish it through my mobile app! Other than that, i love this app!!!","1398":"It\u2019s a good app overall, works as intended. I only have a issue with their misrepresentation of their product. Using wording such as \u201c...always free.\u201d is not correct. You will be required to spend time or money if you choose to stay up to date with the content you enjoy. It\u2019s should be written more along the lines of \u201cyou will be able to access free content from thousands of artists\u201d. It\u2019s really just nit picking but it should be rephrased.","1399":"This is an amazing app that allows people to share their creative story\u2019s. Everything I have read has been good too. The problem is they JUST NOW (after YEARS of being in business) decided to charge people to read. The first one is free and anymore you want to read you have to wait a full 24hrs or pay coins for it. Granted it\u2019s only 99 cents and up but it\u2019s the fact that they just now are doing, it instead at the beginning of their business, during a pandemic. I\u2019m deleting this app and not spending any of my time on it again...\ud83d\udc4e","1400":"I love this app and all the stories especially the romance ones. But I think if you do this it would make the app more fun, I think we should be able to make our own anime comics. At least I would have fun, but I\u2019m pretty sure there are other people who would like that. I\u2019m not saying you have to do that it\u2019s just a suggestion, cause I would love to make a anime comic","1401":"I love this app, my only complaint is that whenever I\u2019m trying to read webtoons while listening to music, my music always stops and doesn\u2019t allow me to play it again from the Control Panel (iOS) when a video advertisement at the end of an episode pops up, and I\u2019m forced to force close the app just to get back to jamming out, and no, it is NOT a webtoon with custom music in the episode.\nBesides that, it\u2019s pretty good.","1402":"I think this app is AMAZING! I have finished season 1 of \u201cblood ink\u201d and I\u2019m waiting for season 2 it is such an amazing app. The one downside I can think of is when trying to sign in they said they sent it to my email, and I triple checked it was the right email, but never received the verification email. Overall it\u2019s an amazing app, and I would definitely recommend it.","1403":"App seems decent but found it pretty low of the company to be using poorly worded advertising on purpose. Was on their website and they said if downloaded the app you could get 3 chapters to read ahead..Download the app and you have to buy all the coins and nothing is free that\u2019s not already on the website. I get you need to make an income, but trying to manipulate people into your app and forcing purchases that could already be on your website is a pretty low way of doing it.","1404":"So Iv have webtoon for about a year or more and I love it. Usually when I\u2019m reading I like to listen to music. But, recently more ads have been coming up. And now there video ads. It pauses my music and then sometimes I accidentally click on the link and it takes me to the site. I go back to where I was and it just repeats the same thing. I have to refresh the app to make it stop sending me to a stupid website. It\u2019s annoying. All I\u2019m trying to do is read and it won\u2019t even let me do so.","1405":"As I am I\u2019m a student and I love comics... but one itty bitty problem with my school... there isn\u2019t a good section of comics yet so I read WEBTOON for all my comics but I can\u2019t find good comics that aren\u2019t on break or doing a season and having to take a break. I love Castle Swimmer but I think people who dislike\/don\u2019t support LGBTQ+ shouldn\u2019t read that one since it does have LGBTQ+ in it I really like a lot of the comics on there!","1406":"-1 Star: Since the last update, I\u2019ve been unable to open the app. And it\u2019s not the first time this has happened.\n\n-1 Star: crashes a few times every now and then, occasionally signs me out for no reason, and didn\u2019t sign on some great authors.\n\nOtherwise, the app is very nice! It gives me a chance to see comics made by authors all over the globe. I especially love the new author area and fan translation areas. Now if I can just be able to open the app again.....","1407":"Ok so 1. It is full of awesome episodes that everyone is entertained by. 2. You can relax in any of the rooms in your house and watch the episodes! 3. You can explore through the episodes and you find awesome storytelling!!! 4. It is probably a game where u have connection to and like you can watch story\u2019s everywhere you go! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f! 5.Ok that is my explainable review in my opinion! Bye!\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude09","1408":"Im not sure if this is Webtoon's fault or just my music app or both, but whenever I try to listen to my music while on the Webtoon app the music pauses. I've had the same problem with Discord, but they fixed it so Im assuming it's a problem with the Webtoon app and not my music app. The app is wonderful and works perfectly besides this and Im addicted to reading the wonderful comics on it. Just hope you can fix this issue in a future update!","1409":"The app itself is great it\u2019s just that when I want to delete chapters that I\u2019ve already read and downloaded it takes a while to delete each one one by one without wanting to delete the ones that I haven\u2019t read. So if you could add a feature that mass deletes chapters without deleting the ones that I have downloaded and read that would give you that extra star.","1410":"As you can guess, yes I read Webtoons on the daily to read my favorite webtoons from my favorite authors but recently the new policy of \u201cmature content\u201d is the main issue at the current moment. It isn\u2019t helping the reading or the authors what so ever. Readers, like myself are constantly being let down because authors are taking down there webtoon\/stories\/chapters due to this new policy. I hope Webtoons makes major decisions in order to solve this issue or the benefit of all who enjoy this wonderful app.","1411":"Alright, so WEBTOON was amazing. The artists\/creators are the best. I love the connection they have with the reader and the webtoons are very good. But the new update for the sexual content is absolute nonsense! These writers censor the most out of the webtoons and with this new update it still isn\u2019t good enough. Some even had to take down their webtoons all together. In my opinion WEBTOON should just have a different section that\u2019s 19+ for webtoons like this so we can still enjoy this content. If you don\u2019t wanna see it than don\u2019t click on the WEBTOON and read it. Simple as that. It feels like WEBTOON is punishing their creators with this update. Not a fan at all","1412":"I have been reading on this platform for over a year and I absolutely love it except for one thing! WEBTOON has changed one of their policies and that makes it so that some writers have to change their stories before continuing to post! I think that writers should be able to fully express their creativity here, like they could in the past, and that this new policy is changing an open, safe place into one that is very restricting and limiting. WEBTOON should be a place to share their hard work with people who appreciate it.","1413":"The new policy thing brought me here. I just wanted to say just because there are some people not comfortable with the NSFW doesn\u2019t mean we all don\u2019t. We don\u2019t all agree on the same thing. Just because some people dislike it does not mean we all have to fall down with them. Let us enjoy what we want without obstacles. I don\u2019t know why the new policy even happened. If some people didn\u2019t like it, they could have skipped it or ignored it. This is why people can\u2019t have nice things.","1414":"Omg I love WEBTOON. It is an amazing app and what makes it even better is that it is FREE!!! Now there is one major issue that I must cover. I am only 10. I find all the swear words a little inappropriate. Even for older kids and adults that should not be aloud. I hope that you can hear my request and change it. Now I TOTALLY request you get it it is amazing. Just ignore the swearing and you will be fine. Thank you. Bye","1415":"(Imma try to keep this short) Okay. Webtoon is AMAZING! I used to be SO bored all the time, but I just pull up Down To Earth (it\u2019s a webtoon) and re-read each and every episode. It\u2019s the best thing to pass the time and it\u2019s the only app I use on my phone now. Amazing comics, beautiful art styles, extremely creative storylines, and SO much more. I really love this! Just letting you know, you\u2019ll be spending a lot of money on this app to get the fast pass episodes. You will be way too invested in the characters. :) \n\nMy favorite Webtoons (if you need recommendations):\nDown To Earth\nAcception\nBlades Of Furry\nAdventures Of God\nSecret Playlist\nLUFF\nCursed Princess Club\nLate Bloomer\nLuggage\n\nSome of those I haven\u2019t finished yet~ lol","1416":"1. For unlocked episodes to remain unlocked forever. I think it\u2019s unfair that the episode locks after 14 days even if you paid for it or waited 24hr for it to unlock. Not cool. It makes me less willing to read finished comics. #enddailypass\n\n2. Love the usernames! Wish we could have little mini avatars to go with our profiles though. \n\n3. PROFILES AND COMMENT HISTORY! I think if we could have this, we would see where (not what they commented to avoid spoilers) to see what people are reading. \n\n4. For there to be a subscription method available for comic reading. I avoid spending on coins because I can\u2019t really track how much I\u2019m spending lol. I think there\u2019d be much more revenue if there was this type of payment method.","1417":"The app is fine itself, I can read all the comics I want, so it\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not fine is the webtoon website, I\u2019ve been trying to publish my webcomic and I needed to size my images down, no problem right totally easy what\u2019s the worst that could happen? Well if I do size my images down, they look very, very bad, so I think you need to work on more space for images on your website, but over all, it\u2019s really good.","1418":"I love this app but the daily pass kinda ruins it. I have some webtoons that I love to reread over and over again but the with the daily pass I can only read two episodes a day except for the first few. And it becomes really annoying for webtoos that have 100 episodes. Or if I want to go back to a particular episode that I love. Like I said I love this app and there is loads of good webtoons that you will never run out.","1419":"Please add killing stalking back to webtoon. I can not find it anywhere else that is moderately free. Most of the other killing stalking you can not read all that of one episode with out having to pay for a fully subscribing when you only just want to read that. But since I read mangas with webtoon I would love to have killing stalking on here as well","1420":"I love this app and I\u2019ve been using it for a long time. It is truly worthy of 5 stars! BUT...it\u2019s been glitching like crazy lately and it kicks me out before I can even open the app. I\u2019ve deleted it and re downloaded it multiple times but it still won\u2019t work. Even after doing the new update it won\u2019t function. WEBTOON please fix this problem ASAP! You have so many supporters that use your app!","1421":"Okay first I love this app it\u2019s great it has all the story\u2019s I love and I would totally recommend it but one day I was reading a story and all of a sudden it exited me out and I was like okay and just decided to opened it up again but that\u2019s when the problem stared to happen I kept going back and forth trying to open up the app but it kept exited me out so like i don\u2019t how to to get back in any feedback please I need one?","1422":"It\u2019s amazing just 1 problem: spoilers. Please make a way for us to turn of comments because I\u2019m reading tower of god right now and the top comments are spoilers I don\u2019t even read all the comments just the top ones and it\u2019s really disappointing and less satisfying when I already know what\u2019s gonna happen again the app is amazing but that kind hurts my reading","1423":"This app is a great way to pass the time I love the story\u2019s so much and can you keep a weekly update for the story castle swimmer I am almost done I am now working on the story unordinary I love it a lot I am reading a lot more than befor I got the Weston app and I now am reading  a lot more and I am now learning more words and now am becoming a lot more fluent with my reading I just love this","1424":"I really like the Webtoon app I completed reading a few stories already but i think it should go back to where we didn\u2019t have to wait five days more or less to read another piece of the story that\u2019s already completed and i think the whole you have to pay this much for these coins to read on should be taken away too but overall i really enjoy reading on this app","1425":"WEBTOON keeps kicking me out of my account and every time I put my emails in and name it keeps saying unavailable email or incomplete and now I can\u2019t read my comics cuz it won\u2019t let me in my account and when I do the thing we\u2019re it\u2019s like if I\u2019m older then 15 I\u2019ll do the stuff but it still won\u2019t let me in so I can\u2019t read my comics \ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\ude21 then I did it again but it said it was completed successfully then it still wouldn\u2019t let me in \ud83d\ude21I just wanted to read my comics \ud83d\ude14","1426":"Alright, so when this first started, and by that I mean you get on the app and the moment you click on something it freezes, when it first started I wondered, the heck.\nSo I went to reviews and checked to see if others were having the same issue, and I was shocked to see MANY having the issue due to the new update that came around two to one day ago, so can ya fix it?","1427":"Up until two days ago I would\u2019ve given this app a five star rating. I love the stories and the artists are all so very talented. Yesterday, however, the app wouldn\u2019t let anything load. I restarted my phone and it was like the whole thing was stuck. I hope this is a problem that gets fixed soon because I miss my comics. I tried deleting and re-downloading the app, but it was still the same. Please fix this soon! Thank you! \ud83d\ude38","1428":"The app is great and all. I love reading the work of creators it makes my day! I just don\u2019t really love the coins thing. Its not that I\u2019m broke and don\u2019t have money to buy new episodes, I\u2019m just tired of reading the same thing in the top comments \u201chahah coin squad\u201d or \u201c read this before all of you cause I have coins\u201d. I loved getting to the bottom of the webtoons and seeing all the comments discussing things that happened in the webtoon.","1429":"Was satisfied with this app until I got to episode 85 on true beauty, I was so disappointed and aggravated that I had to pay because I loved that series so much and I am broke so stop making us pay to read our manga!!!!! I would give it 5 stars but I cannot because you have to pay! I was so disappointed and I hope you make updates in the future where you do not have to pay because I simply can\u2019t live without true beauty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","1430":"I really enjoy reading comics from this app, but recently they\u2019ve been having troubles with in-app purchases, they double charged me in January 17 (around $20), would not give me what I bought even though the app recognizes that I payed, and I\u2019m still waiting for the refund. Yesterday same thing happened again, and now I\u2019ll probably gonna have to go through all the process again. I\u2019m really mad, and its even worse they haven\u2019t done any update to fix this problem, not only do I loose my money, but they won\u2019t let me buy any more coins so I am here waiting to read my comics.","1431":"First off, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that I see some people trying to review bomb this app. Idk what all the fuss is about \u201cmature content\u201d being on the app. If you don\u2019t want to read the \u201cmature content\u201d then don\u2019t read it. This is an amazing app, people need to use their discretion. Also, children shouldn\u2019t be left unsupervised with phones or internet devices anyhow.","1432":"This a really good app but I\u2019d just like to report a bug that\u2019s really annoying. After using the app for a while it says no internet connection yet I have one. The only way to resolve this bug is to delete and redone load which can just be annoying at times. So just a bug keep up that hard work!","1433":"This app is absolutely amazing! It\u2019s great for artist and story writers to put their stuff out there!\nI\u2019m having a slight problem with WEBTOON though, I type in my email and when I click \u201csign up now\u201d it sends me right back to email and says \u201center email address\u201d even though I have.\nI don\u2019t know what it is, probably just me being stupid! Anyways, lovely app and I enjoy it a lot.","1434":"i really love webtoon, and i WANT to give it a 5-outta-5-star rating; however, i cannot. recently, the app has been glitching so much for me, for example: not letting me open stories, freezing constantly (especially on the home page), not saving my place in stories, etc. it\u2019s super hard to enjoy the app when it doesn\u2019t always work for me. other than those issues, i absolutely love it!","1435":"I really love webtoon because I can read comics made by people that aren\u2019t super famous (though I love featured ones too) I was a bit aggravated by the amount of people making super nsfw webtoons though (I mean I understand gore and stuff but people were posting full on 18+ stuff) I really appreciate that webtoon made it so people can\u2019t post stuff like that anymore.","1436":"I love webtoon but their is a new policy that is making it so authors are limited to what they can and can\u2019t post. Now I understand part of it but some authors are having to delete their hole comic just because of this policy. I\u2019m not saying webtoon is a bad app I use it everyday. But one thing that would make everything better is for this policy to go away. No one wants the policy, and if the creators are seeing this. Please get rid of it, make it so you have to confirm your age with an email or something, because this policy is just making people angry.","1437":"I hope the new rules from the update get taken down\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f A bunch of my fav stories have been ruined because the authors can\u2019t draw what they want anymore. They have to follow the new rules from the update and that affects the story lines a lot!  I used to love WEBTOON but the update made me like this app a lot less. This NSFW policy should be taken down. I don\u2019t thinks it\u2019s fair that stories are being taken down because of content.  Stories with NSFW scenes have a warning that warns you about how you might be offended or whatever. If you are offended then don\u2019t read that WEBTOON!! Duh \ud83d\ude44.  Take down the new policy and then I\u2019ll like WEBTOON again.","1438":"I love all the comics in webtoon, I love searching for new stuff to read, but the recent update made comic rules stricter, and a ton of the webtoons I follow religiously are dropping like flies because they can\u2019t continue writing under the new rules. I don\u2019t wanna leave webtoon for other sites and apps that my favorite comics are moving to. I love webtoon, but some of it needs to change.","1439":"Within the first minute of downloading the app, I got 3 full screen ads (one being a super annoying \u201ccomplete these tasks before you can close this window\u201d game ad) before even getting the chance to read anything or even explore the app in any way. I get that they want people to subscribe for an ad-free experience, but if the free version is going to accost readers with ads after every single tap on the screen, it\u2019s already time to uninstall. Even a simple introduction tour of the app would have been nice before being spammed with advertisements.","1440":"I love the app and it is very entertaining for me and many others, but I will say I DESPISE\/HATE the coin thing. I am not logged in and I don\u2019t want to log in to the app with email and if I do I have to pay for coins to  read the new episodes. If I don\u2019t, I have to wait days. Sometimes it\u2019s 6 days sometimes 9 and sometimes 10 even. I wish webtoon could change this. That\u2019s one star taken off.","1441":"I love this app so much! It has had such a positive impact on my life I am SO SO glad I found it! The only thing I would like to be improved is if you could subscribe to more then 100 discover WEBTOON\u2019s. I\u2019d like to support every comic I love not just a select few I hate not being able to support every WEBTOON I love. Overall though, this is the best app I have ever encountered. There is great things in store for this app!!","1442":"WEBTOONS IS LITERALLY THE GREATEST APP EVER. I love how webtoons are easily accessible and easy to read. Ad placements are no problem and don\u2019t interfere with reading, browsing, commenting and giving likes, etc. Giving support to the creators through likes, buying related merch. There\u2019s so much interaction between fans, authors, and even opportunities for internships. Webtoons is a gOsh DolLy bEst aPp 11\/10 I\u2019d recommend to everyone even my teacher shdjsjds.","1443":"I\u2019ve been looking for something like this for fOREveR. Like no crap. But I finally found it and if your looking for shine quality comics this is the place. They have everything for everyone and every age. It really isn\u2019t hard to find a story on here that deeply connects with you, as if it was made just for you. And I really love that. Download it, you won\u2019t regret it.","1444":"I've loved reading comics on webtoon ever since I found it, but these coins and passes just my my experience worse. I don't mean to hate! No, no, I just don't like that I have to wait 3 days in order to read ONE EPISODE. I mean What The Heck?! And you need to PAY for the coins. We make money to save it, not spend it on something like this. Sorry for complaining, but I just Don't. Want. To. Wait. Three. Days. To. Read. Something.","1445":"This is a very good app, this wasn\u2019t meant to be a review but Idk how to ask questions but I\u2019d give this app five stars, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s a way to up the webtoons resolution on IPad because everything on IPad looks kinda crappy and my phone broke recently so It\u2019s either my computer(meaning I can\u2019t daily pass or fast pass) or this so does someone know how to up the res?","1446":"I love this app. I really do, like obsessively love it. I\u2019ve spent hundreds on these coins over the years.... BUT this is the second time in the last 6 weeks that an update has completely deleted my account. It\u2019s more that just needing to register my device. My logins deactivated, purchased episodes gone, subscriptions gone, and all my coins deleted. My help inquiries have gone unaddressed. So so so frustrating. \n\nThe least they could do is offer me a response, condolences, or offer to refund my lost coins.","1447":"I really like it cause I can read all I want, of course you have to buy coins, but you can also wait until the day it updates. If your into romance go read: age matters, I love yoo, let\u2019s play, the kiss bet, AntiStalker, my deepest secret, down to earth.... and there\u2019s LOTS more, it\u2019s a great place to share your comics if your just starting out! You can even earn a little money.","1448":"so, i used to be absolutely obsessed with this app. i had a bunch of favorite stories and everything and i was super invested. one day, i opened up the app, and everything was some kind of chinese or korean. i have no idea why the language suddenly changed from english, which i can read and understand, to a foreign language, without even changing it! i lost all my stories and i don\u2019t know what to do. i can\u2019t even change it back because i have no idea what any of the words say! ive consulted the internet and still nothing helps. the only reason im giving this app a 3 stars is because of the language glitch. before that happened, this app would be a 5 stars. i don\u2019t know if anyone also has this problem, but i would love some kind of advice or help? thanks.","1449":"I really love the app even though fast pass is annoying bc we need to wait incredibly long, but then we got a daily stamp for five coins if we long in five days, I competed it but then it said to reload because there was a error, I did and now the stamp isn\u2019t there and I don\u2019t have the coins, that was a big problem for me but he app is amazing and it feels like I\u2019m able to read thousands of books, besides the fast pass.","1450":"honestly i like webtoon they have amazing comics but i wouldn\u2019t waste my money of this.. I have to wait for 14 days just to read a comic honestly it gets ridiculous. And i\u2019m also pretty broke. There is so many interesting comics though but still wouldn\u2019t waste so much money for these types of things. honestly it just makes me mad. especially on very good parts. Webtoon really need to change itself. This is just my opinion btw so don\u2019t get mad. Also if you\u2019re as broke as i am i\u2019m sure u would understand.","1451":"I can\u2019t stress this enough. Webtoon is AMAZING!!! I know you have to buy fast passes but it\u2019s just part of the fun, eating every week for a new update! Fantasizing what could happen in the next chapter. Some people don\u2019t like that you have to wait a week but you just have to have appreciation for the author and artists that put their heart and soul into the comic. Get it my peeps \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","1452":"I really love webtoon and it\u2019s my favorite thing to read in my free time. Also all of the comics are even free if you wait long enough. My only problem is that I am not allowed to watch the ads when I want to. It works rarely, and most of the time I can\u2019t read the episodes when I want to. I beg you to please fix this problem because it really bugs me that I can\u2019t read the episodes that can be unlocked by just watching an ad.","1453":"I really enjoy Webtoon and I use FastPass when I feel indulgent. But reason I hardly use Fast Pass is because when you use it, you have to wait 1-2 weeks for the next episode. I feel like if you Fast Pass an episode the next one should be available in the time it would\u2019ve taken for the previous episode- e.g the 7 days ep. + Fast Pass= 0 days & the 14 days ep. now becomes a 7 day availability.","1454":"GUYS! This app is amazing and I love all the comics on here but the only thing I don\u2019t like is the new update! I\u2019ve had this app for a few years but the \u201creward ads\u201d are very hard to actually get to work. It hardly ever works and I have to retry at least 40 times before it gives me an ad to watch! Other than that it works pretty smooth! I hope they fix this problem soon \ud83d\ude2d","1455":"This app is amazing for people who like to read comics and whatnot. Simple setup for you to discover more things to read. I honestly wouldn\u2019t even mind if there were more ads because they pay the authors for views. So it\u2019s like a win-win for everyone. The only ads are like on the bottom of comics. I love that they dont pop up at any time. Just a great app, love it. Good job.","1456":"I don\u2019t usually write reviews but if you\u2019re like me and love to read than this is the app for you! \nSeriously the art style in the stories are amazing and I like how they let you choose the art style you prefer. \nThe stories are very well written and I enjoy reading my favorites with a cup of coffee before school and some chill music \nGreat app 10\/10 \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb","1457":"This is a good app if you\u2019re looking for to read a lot of really good stories, but I have a suggestion. I was wondering if you could add a superset BL section in the Romance genre cause I\u2019m trying to find good ones to read and I can\u2019t find any cause their all mixed. If you\u2019re looking for an app that has a separate BL section, Tapas does and you can read episode that are censored on WEBTOON that are uncensored on Tapas","1458":"I fall deep into reading all these stories. The connection is so real to the characters, and the artists truly have their way with setting such a captivating experience. Ive never thought i would spend money on an app for such things as unlocking new things, but this app drives a hard bargain and I see myself buying the coins and even fast passes! Im truly a huge fan!! \u2764\ufe0f","1459":"Honestly my favorite app on my phone. It has such a wide variety of comics, and all of them are enjoyable. There are no ads, and it never glitches or is slow. It provides hours and hours of entertainment. I seriously stay up way too late reading all the amazing comics, I just can\u2019t get enough. I seriously recommend it!!","1460":"I don't know if other people are experiencing this issue as well, when i get to the end of the page when reading, the ads there (usually a twitter ad) automatically take me out of the webtoon ad and onto the app store to download whatever was advertised! i dont know where to mention this but it\u2019s seriously irritating.\nOther than that, I love Webtoon","1461":"I love webtoon so much, I just wish I could figure out how to make a story on it even though the drawling will be super bad, I\u2019m gonna ask my friend probably but anyways I wanted to say I love webtoon and I go on it every day because it is the best and it gives a chance for people to show themselves, and I love that! Hope I figure out soon so I can, maybe, make people happy!","1462":"This is a wonderful app to introduce someone to the comic\/manga world. There is a huge range of comics here and you\u2019ll be sure to find one you enjoy. I read webtoons daily and I\u2019m always excited for my favorite creators to upload. I do find it that I cannot change my time zone so the dates for uploads are one day ahead. Otherwise it allows me to have easy access to manga.","1463":"Webtoons was amazing, until they updated with a new policy against what artists could post\/ speak on. Which I can see why, but to a certain extent it feels unfair to the readers and the artist, some things go with the plot and if they cannot speak on it to an extent of what\u2019s appropriate for everyone it\u2019s a let down on both sides. I get some people go over the top but I believe it\u2019s unfair to those who stay in the guidelines. I hope in the future they adjust it to fair guidelines,so the readers and the artists can have a fair place to post their work.","1464":"This app is very good!! I love all of the stories and there are new ones everyday!! I do not really like combos that much but this app is a must! I suggest that you read \"I Love Yoo\" its a very good story! I got all caught up (there were 65 episodes) in little less then 2 days!! I highly suggest that you get this app and read that story!! Another god story is \"Girls of the wild\" So please please please get this app!!! It won't disappoint you! \ud83d\ude01","1465":"I downloaded this app over a year ago to read one comic. Since then, I have discovered and been introduced to so many wonderful artists and stories. The app is incredibly user friendly, and I have never had it crash on me. I use this app more than  anything else on my phone. Download it and find yourself a beautiful story to fall into!","1466":"This is the best comic app ever and even has a discover section so that if you ever get bored of the countless featured comics which update weekly you can find new comics made by anyone. Also everything is free and there\u2019s like 1 add every 5 comics and it isn\u2019t a video. Overall a really positive experience, can\u2019t tell you how many hours I\u2019ve spent reading great stories. I recommend.","1467":"This app, is simply flawless, there\u2019s no other word to describe it. There are so many greatly written comics on there that everybody of all genders and interests will love. You\u2019ll get so involved with this app that, if you found a great comic for yourself, you\u2019ll find yourself holding your device in the bathroom trying to catch up with the latest chapters.","1468":"Literally the best comic app on the App Store that I\u2019ve encountered so far. All the other ones that advertise on Facebook only give a few chapters before you gotta start using $$$ to get more.\n\nWhereas here you get to just keep on reading and reading till your either fine stopping where you\u2019re at or the comic your reading ends. And then you move onto the next one!","1469":"First off, I love this app! There are a lot of great webtoons to read on here. My problem is that it's not consistent after updates. It was working fine for me for ages, then after the most recent update it won't make it past the load screen. This happened two updates ago as well. I'm not sure what to make of it because it was working fine a couple days ago. I would rate this 5 stars all day if it would be consistent.","1470":"I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s just me but I\u2019ve been trying to buy 10 coins that costs 0.99 but every time I press it, It just loads for hours and when it does work I press the pay button and when it says purchase it says error has occurred. I\u2019m not sure how these reviews work but if you can comment on them can somebody please tell me how to fix this?","1471":"The comics are great but the platform and people are not. Freedom of speech doesn\u2019t seem to matter much here. I quoted a psalm on one of my personal webcomics and someone followed me saying he was going to \u201cBurn my F\u2019\u2019\u2019ing church to the ground\u201d. However, nothing happened. In fact- I got reported for the Bible verse being \u201cinsensitive\u201d and I was unable to comment for about a month. The terrorist however, received no punishment, and followed me screaming f bombs. No feedback from WEBTOON HQ either. The art is beautiful and the stories gripping, but I wish I could freely express my beliefs without being called a bigot and without being attacked, reported, cancelled and censored.","1472":"Ok to start things I absolutely love this app I have been using it for almost a year now and I have used it almost nonstop but recently I went to open it and it didn\u2019t work so I tried to remove the app I tried restarting my phone everything I could think of and it still does the same thing where I open it and it immediately closes so please fix it","1473":"I\u2019m not gonna lie I absolutely ADORE this app and it\u2019s webtoons like unordinary, lumine, tower of god etc. but then comes in this coin system and I\u2019m like \u201cwow ok well the authors gotta eat somehow\u201d and move on but then you banning webtoons because of their nsfw stories and all the scam ads and the daily pass feature it\u2019s become annoying I\u2019m not trying to bash the app I love it but in all honesty you need to change or fix up these features.","1474":"I started on webtoon like 6 years ago and had it for a long time but recently downloaded it again. I was taken by surprise that they started the \u201c2 episodes daily\u201d thing for completed webtoons. I always loved webtoon because of the fact that they didn\u2019t try to rip you off like other apps but now they stooped down to the same level as the others. Why Webtoon? You used to be so good but now it\u2019s turned to trash... if they didn\u2019t have that issue it would definitely be 5\/5 stars...","1475":"WEBTOON worked great for 3 years. I would definitely rate it 5 stars, but just recently I opened the app and all my progress was gone. There were no bookmarks or history of me reading books. I did still have all my favorites in one place. The app also became very slow and will freeze or not work properly if I tap a WEBTOON I want to read. I love this app very much and enjoy the stories within it, so please help and fix this problem.","1476":"I can\u2019t recommend this app! I lost access to a comic because of some kind of connection error that refused to resolve itself. And now I can\u2019t log in because it leads you to another slow buggy desktop variant of the website and even when I do log in it doesn\u2019t log me into the app. And even if I want to retry to log in by logging out, that button too, is locked out and refuses to do so.","1477":"This app is great and I had no problem with it up until recently. Whenever I click on this app it works for a bit and then just suddenly closes. No matter how many times I reload the app or restart my iPad, this problem isn\u2019t fixed. If this is a glitch in the app itself, please fix it.","1478":"Webtoon is an amazing app, but there\u2019s a small bug that makes me very frustrated. I\u2019ll just be reading comics on webtoon, when it\u2019ll suddenly freeze and take me out of the app. Not sure if this is something to do with the app or my Ipad, but if it has something to do with the app, please fix this. It gets me very aggravated. And I\u2019ve tried to uninstall and reinstall it. Nothing is working. Please fix this if this has something to do with the app immediately.","1479":"So I had to switch phone about 3-4 times in the last year & everytime I do so that I download the app I have to start reading the stories all over again I mean I don\u2019t mind that but it\u2019s just like I\u2019ve already read to a certain part where it\u2019s interesting so I kinda would appreciate if you\u2019d find a way to fix it because it\u2019s annoying to log in & re read everything all over again so please fix that thank you.","1480":"I really like WEBTOON and all the comics. If I were to suggest a comic or reading platform, it would be this one. I however have one problem. I do not have a computer or the resources required to make a comic and I would really like to be able to write a comic on mobile. If possible please try to make a format to make a comic on mobile. That is my only problem so if you can fix it I would rate five stars.","1481":"Okay as an artist I was trying to figure out why can\u2019t I draw my own comics just for love of art and fun. But I tried everything and all I saw was canvas I mean click on a couple of times but honestly I kept going in circles cause I would say click her if you would like to make a comic? So I was frustrated It might be a bug but I have no clue if y\u2019all are having this problem then I suggest just read. The comics they are great especially the authors who put a lot of work in to them\ud83d\udc4d but as I said if your trying to make your own comic or series good luck","1482":"I\u2019ve had Webtoon for a couple of months now and I love it, the way people get to tell there stories in a fun and interesting way; but the new policy ruins it in a way because if your scrolling for a new series and you find one you like and it\u2019s like 100 episodes in and all you see for some of the episodes is \u201cDue to webtoons new policy this chapter was deleted\u201d It makes you miss the storyline and is kinda annoying.","1483":"WEBTOON was by far my favorite online reading app and notice how I use was recently it doesn\u2019t let me and many other users go to newer chapters of their comics but instead replace it with a error there\u2019s something wrong with your internet and server problems please try again later even though my wifi is fine because I checked everything 3 times. \n\nPlease!!!! Fix this!!!!!!","1484":"I\u2019ve been using this app a long time and it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve never had any issues with the app until recently. This just now happening about 2 weeks ago, I cannot use my coins to purchase the new episodes. I know it\u2019s not a huge deal but would still like it to get fixed. Other than that GREAT APP. Idc if there\u2019s a bug atm, it deserves 5 stars","1485":"I would give it 5 stars because I absolutely love this app but recently I have come across a problem, the ad rewards are not loading. This could be a problem on my end but it makes me rather disappointed that it cannot load the ads, therefore I am unable to read the next episode, please help me if you can.","1486":"I enjoy the app for the most part but it\u2019s so frustrating that the app logs me out sometimes and when I try to sign in it says my email isn\u2019t registered but when I try to re-register with the same email it says it\u2019s already been registered...so which one is it? Is it registered or not registered? It doesn\u2019t happen often but I get so irritated when it does because I can\u2019t access the stories I\u2019ve subscribed to.","1487":"I absolutely love WEBTOON. The comics and creators on this app are amazing and I am really happy with it. But, recently I\u2019ve seen that this app just flat out crashes all the time!! When I\u2019m reading a comic, it gets stuck on a panel and the whole screen freezes. Then I have to manually exit the app and reopen WEBTOON. If that only happened once or twice I would be fine with it. BUT IT HAPPENS EVERY 5 MINUTES. I will gladly change my rating when this bug is fixed. But, still a great app.","1488":"I love this app so much! I like how the description of the comic tells you when it\u2019s going to be updated. It also uses a good reminder (by using a symbol) when a webtoon is being paused or has been UPdated. Webtoon is just a great app except for the fact that I couldn\u2019t sign up on a new account on my IPad. But I love the fact that you can have music in your webtoon!","1489":"About 2 years ago I would get tons and tons of the same add everyday, that add was Webtoon!!! So I eventually got it and feel in love with were the comics took you! It's my runaway fantasy world in each comic! Not to mention I subscribe to a ton of comics so I can read almost 4 to 8 comics a day! Although I wish I could post my own comic\u2026 that's besides the point! Webtoon is life and life is Webtoon\u2764\ufe0f","1490":"This is by far my favorite app! Not only is it free but u can read hundreds of comics anywhere. I love to read the comments amend post some of my own. I also love how interactive the creators are with their readers. The stories are amazing and don\u2019t forget about the art! The only problem I have run into was the slow loading times when I had bad reception.","1491":"I love the authors on this app but seriously the app is a disappointment. Sometimes I have to click several of times before it actually works (doesn\u2019t happen in any other app). When it loads it gets laggy. The biggest thing is that they removed the tap to scroll! It was one of the main reasons why I used the app. The convenience is now gone, going to look for another app. 5\/5 for the stories but 1\/5 for the app.","1492":"Man, this is sad to do because Webtoons are my life but why the heck would someone think pop up ads are a good idea to interrupt a story-based experience? I\u2019d rather pay money once than continually have ads pop up in the freaking middle of the story. I can\u2019t focus on the story at all with these pop up ads :\\ The last straw was when I was reading The Steam Dragon Express (really short Webtoon for those that don\u2019t know) and got 3 ads within 5 seconds because of the length of the Webtoon. For short chapters, ads get in the way of everything. Why not just multiple banners at the end and such?","1493":"I really thought this was a really good app. At first I when I saw an ad of this app, I was really skeptical but then this app was really fun to use. All the stories have something that makes it interesting and the stories have plot twists and really suspenseful. This app is a great way to kill time and also  has different contents of stories you are liking. Thank you to the creators of this app!","1494":"Well, let\u2019s see I\u2019ve had this app for a while now. I love it, it\u2019s pretty good. Might load slow sometimes but it\u2019s great. BUT this new Daily Pass thing. \ud83d\ude10, not great. I don\u2019t want to wait a day to read a COMPLETED series. I\u2019m sorry but this isn\u2019t like the canvas ones, these are completed. Let me enjoy them at my own pace, so if I\u2019d like to read 20 episodes in a day then let me.","1495":"Daily pass is a joke. I can't go back and read alot of the old stories I loved so much such as orange marmalade for example. One a day. Really. Donating to a creator is one thing. I would do that. But giving my money to webtoon so I can read someone else's creation I don't think so. I certainly don't want to take away money that could be going to the creator but webtoon this is how you have people going and looking for other places to read.","1496":"Apparently WEBTOON doesn\u2019t take complaints seriously. I everything disappear from my account so I requested they take a look into so I can get at least the chapters of WEBTOONs I have already paid for back not even thinking about my unused coins. I haven\u2019t heard anything in over two weeks so I am guess I have to go to my bank and contest ALL the charges from WEBTOON because I didn\u2019t get what I was promised but had it taken away and expected to pay them again to purchase what I already had. Such a shame because there are so many brilliant creators on this platform.","1497":"I love this app and I buy fast pass every so often. Today I went to buy fast pass and it says that only one registered device can purchase and to change device to be able to purchase. My device is the only device that pops up and I don\u2019t know what to do. Please fix this for me.","1498":"I have been using this app for quite some time now and they recent implemented a daily pass system for completed webtoons. Personally, I think its a stupid idea and should have never been implemented in the first place. If it weren't for the current webtoons I am waiting on, I would have deleted this app. Please fix this!! I am not the only one who is upset about this!! \nOther than that, everything is great and the app is amazing! :)","1499":"This app is amazing and I love it, but I\u2019m having I minor problem and it\u2019s that the app is not starting by what I mean is each time I try to get on the app it doesn\u2019t want to open and just closes itself and I tried to turn off my phone and do it again but it doesn\u2019t work. So I kinda need help to see how I open it.","1500":"I love WEBTOON and I used to love leggings as well but then Lezgun started adding completed daily passes to their things. I stopped using that app because of it. But now because they have the daily passes for my favorite WEBTOON I think it\u2019s stupid. I would rather spend my money on ongoing WEBTOON. Please take off the completed daily passes I think that it is unnecessary and at this point WEBTOON is getting money hungry.","1501":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. The art is amazing, and there is a wide selection of comics, ranging from romance and comedy to horror and action. I highly suggest you get this app! Some comics I suggest are Lore Olympus, Lookism, and Castle Swimmers. One thing I would like to say is that the ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIS APP ARE UNAPPEALING. The ads where you have people review the comics are cringy, and made me not want to buy the app. Other than that I have no problems!","1502":"I honestly LOVE this app, but many of the stories have \u201cfast passes\u201d which you have to buy. I just wish we didn\u2019t have those, because people read ahead using those passes, and then go back to the past episode and spoil it. Other than that, this app has kept me entertained a lot and is always fun and interesting. This app is truly AMAZING and awesome!","1503":"First off, I\u2019m a big fan of WEBTOON and it\u2019s content. During the quarantine I wanted to reread completed stories, but found out that I only ha d a select few available to read. I just don\u2019t see how having a daily pass for a couple of episodes. And then not being able to have them available after 14 days makes sense. I already finished it and just want to enjoy it again.","1504":"The content of the app and its users are all great but the uploads take too long. My only issue are the uploads. Since each episode is in the process of being completed, it can take several years for one series to end. This makes some of the readers, or at least the people I have shared this app with and myself, become less interested in each story. It is still a great app. \n\nThank you.","1505":"Has anyone else experience the problem of the app not opening on smart phone it is my second time with this issue. The only thing i have found to help is to delete the app which becomes a pain if you have a lot of comics like i do. If anyone knows how to fix i would greatly appreciate the assistance.","1506":"I actually enjoy this app because of the different stories I come across. Was never a big fan of comics until Webtoon. The only problem I have is that when I download a series, it still takes a while to load them. \n\nWhich makes me question what the point of downloading is if it still doesn't load anything? Does downloading support offline use? \n\nWhere I work, my signal is poor so I figured downloading would actually help but it hasn't really. Is there a fix for this? That's the only reason my review is a 4-star. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nOtherwise, app is great. Besides the whole \"coin purchasing\" thing. Another review on its own. But mainly want solutions for this downloading issue... is anyone else experiencing this?","1507":"I have been reading WEBTOON for a year now.. It is in my daily routine of my day. However, I love leaving comments for all of my comics! And once in a while, I like to go back to my comments and read them and have a good laugh. Sometimes I write things I don\u2019t even remember I wrote! What I am trying to say is, I have around 200 comments? I have to press \u201cnext.\u201d But, guess what... it doesn\u2019t work \ud83e\udd28","1508":"I love this app so much! It makes my day every day, and I\u2019m always so excited to read whatever updates come in! I have a bunch of favorites and even more that I casually read, and I have enough in my library that at least two update every day! \n\nWEBTOON stories make the hard days easier, and I\u2019m so lucky that I found my way to it! \n\nThank you, WEBTOON team!\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f","1509":"I love Weebtoon and how professional it is. Featured comics have a consistent upload schedule and you don\u2019t even have to pay! The art is really good, and so are the stories. There is a wide variety of comics covering many genres. There is something for everyone on this app. Most of the stories are unique. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes comics or manga","1510":"I was really interested in this app when I saw the ads but what\u2019s the point of getting this crap if I can\u2019t evean sign up like I put in my freaking email in and I try to tap sign up but it won\u2019t work and when I tap it it\u2019ll just put it to the email and it says email address and I\u2019m putting in my email but I don\u2019t know if I have to put in my address and I\u2019m not doing that so you ppl can stock me so I\u2019m putting in my email and nothing happens so why did I wast my data and time on this app it\u2019s worthless and I\u2019m pretty sure the stories weren\u2019t going to be that good anyways","1511":"I used to absolutely love this app, unfortunately they just made a new system where you have to BUY episodes with money to be able to read the end of the webtoons!!! I HATE this new system and that\u2019s why this rating is so low, my family doesn\u2019t have enough money to be able to pay for the stupid service! And I get having to earn money but can\u2019t they find some other way! I know it\u2019s hard to run a business but I can\u2019t afford to buy episodes and I don\u2019t want to wait them out! Please fix this!","1512":"Awesome app with loads of great comics to read through, plenty of different genres to meet everyone\u2019s tastes. \n\nTook off one star for the small bug where it doesn\u2019t always seem to say when some subscribed comics update, I have to manually go look at the episode list to see if there are any new ones. Otherwise it has a great interface, loads of content, and is overall a great app for web comics.","1513":"I love webtoon but lately they have been so strict with their new policy\u2019s and I\u2019m so tired of it \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude24 like some of my favorite webtoon pages have been DELETED!!!! I\u2019m talking about like the nsfw content! I mean come on webtoon are you serious there are enough warnings and age restrictions that a kid would know not to keep reading, so why did you change it?!?! I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for almost 3 years already and... now that the nsfw has been taken off I\u2019m furious and by looking at the reviews and ratings and reply\u2019s, I can tell that a lot of other people have the same opinion so please just bring it back!","1514":"I loved this app so much cause I could read basically anything but because of the new policy many creators have to remove their comic or delete it or move to a new app because they do what they have been doing and it\u2019s ruining the app so Please remove the new policy dealing with NSFW and \u201cadult\u201d content they give warnings about the NSFW plus it censors the actual private parts plus the app even asks if you are 19 and older so Please remove this \u201cas most people consider\u201d ridiculous policy on NSFW\/Adult content","1515":"I use to love the most out of my apps were I can read mangas, but then they created a new policy because of a lot of people who didn\u2019t like the mature stuff reported it, I mean the warning is there for a reason and if you were underaged then don\u2019t go reading the reporting it the warning is there for that exact reason that it\u2019s a mature comic!","1516":"Everything is great, comics are good, barely any ads, all for free, BUT: What's with this new policy Webtoon? No Mature content, even if it's censored? We were ok with this, but many BL artists are stopping their comics! And that isn't ok! I understand that children may be seeing these things, but it isn't Webtoon's fault! Their parents should be the ones restricting what they can see!\n\nUgh, I'm so conflicted! I know you guys are probably doing the better thing but... So many BL comics and artists... We're losing them, Webtoon!!","1517":"I love webtoons. It gives the readers a chance to read great works. I especially enjoy reading works made by writers that even though they do not do this as their main job continue to give us great works because of their passion for their craft. I just wish we could subscribe to more. It is very limited to how many you can subscribe and being that sone writers do not post regularly sometimes you miss some chapters.","1518":"I\u2019m giving 4 stars because I absolutely love this app!! But for about a week now it hasn\u2019t been showing me which comics have been updating at the top. I have to go in and find the individual comics for the day. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s doing this but it\u2019s a bit annoying. Can we fix that please? I\u2019m scared to delete it because someone lost all of their stuff, and I don\u2019t want that to happen.","1519":"To be honest, this app is better than social media, coming from an introvert. I\u2019m a person who loves love stories and likes to read so, win win. This app is the only reason I look forward to Mondays (oh holy). Sometimes I will end up finding a really good comic, binge read it til 4 am, and fall asleep in class. The worst part about this app is that it gives me unrealistic love expectations. - and l\u2019m 13","1520":"Love WEBTOON but it\u2019s srsly so annoying my place is never kept. I\u2019ve been using this app for years and I\u2019ve lost so many stories because it never seems to remember which stories I\u2019m subscribed to, let alone where I left off so I\u2019m left to scroll through hundreds of episodes to find my place again. They need to work on a bookmark system that is more secure and actually works.","1521":"I loved this platform webtoon, it\u2019s a very good platform and recommend it to so many people. To realize that they have daily pass now? I dislike having to read a new episode every 14 days ? I would understand like 1 day or a couple of hours, I used to always go back to old series and re-read series. Highly disappointed I\u2019ve been using this app for 4 years now. :(","1522":"The comics are works by single artist or a team of an artist writer\/editor and everyone reads everything so if you comment your opinion and it\u2019s not positive or inline with everyone else don\u2019t expect it to get friendly engagement because it won\u2019t. \nOther than that and not having an adult section it\u2019s perfect.","1523":"I have no complaints about this app .. It is perfect in every way and I never came into ANY problems while using the app.. 100% recommended if you like to read a very good story.. I hope you have as much fun as I do when I read on this app.. Have a good day fine males and female and just know you are perfect in ever way !","1524":"I LOVE this app, and I would put five stars. But, I\u2019m having this glitch where when I press a story, and where all the chapters are supposed to be, is just white. It\u2019s not happening to every one I read, but it\u2019s happening to a lot of them. I hope it gets fixed? Or maybe it\u2019s just my WiFi, but I went to the place where my WiFi is strongest, and it still wouldn\u2019t work... \ud83d\ude15","1525":"So I love webtoon. I REALLY DO! I love age matters true beauty my deepest secret phase stalker x stalker acception but the thing is that I have to wait a week for the next episode it just makes me sad that\u2019s its money but pls don\u2019t take that in a rude way I know that u guys need money but overall this is the best reading app ever,I recommend for you to try age matters,true beauty,stalker x stalker,phase,my deepest secret,acception","1526":"I would\u2019ve gave it 5 stars if they never changed this so before when a webtoon finish or they\u2019re done making more episodes it used to just let us read it with nothing but now you read like 10 episodes then you have to wait another day to read the other ones so you keep have to wait another day just to see what\u2019s gonna happen should\u2019ve just kept it the same","1527":"I redone loaded this app to try and catch up on some of my favorite series I was 30+ episodes into, but despite me already being so far in the app has rest my progress and because of this daily pass system, which only gives me one free episode per day (a episode is like a thirty second read tops) that means it\u2019ll take me a month to just catch up in my favorite stories, let alone finish one hundred episode plus pieces. I hope this system gets removed as I liked the way it was","1528":"I LOVE webtoon but I HATE the daily pass reason 1:one of the first webtoon I read and why I started reading webtoon is because of days of Hana my aboulute best and best one to re-read if I get bored and now I have to wait once a day to read them. I am fine with the once a week ones but every time I think ima go re-read days of Hana or good day to be a dog or ghost wife or unTouchable or super secret I can\u2019t do it and that kinda makes me sad","1529":"I love the app. It is very entertaining, organized and easy to use. But I don't like when it comes to linking my account to other devices. For example, if I have the same account on two devices and I read an episode using one of them, it won't reflect as read on the other device so I get lost every time I want to continue reading the series.","1530":"This is a short response, Because I don't have time to write a whole essay. Webtoon is such a great app, I readed 20 comics. Until this bug came. It says, \"Server issues please try again later.\" And there is this 2 options that say, \"Retry\" \"Cancel\" Ofc, I would pick retry. Then it just came again. I'm on wifi, turning the screen to down and so is the volume, Still didnt work. Please fix this bug, its so annoying I cant even read any comics.","1531":"This app by far has the best content and I feel it\u2019s pretty easy for artists to publish their content. Lately I\u2019ve had issues accessing canvas episodes as the app prompts me to watch an ad video. When I agree to watch it, the app pops up the message \u201cunable to load\u201d and kicks me out of the episode. Either remove this ad requirement or get it to function properly.","1532":"So I\u2019ve had this for a long time, and I\u2019ve loved it. Great comics, little to no ads, have had hardly any trouble with it. But recently I\u2019ve noticed that the app randomly glitches, like when I\u2019m done reading an update on a story I try to exit the whole story it just freezes. Which is fine, because I just exit out and refresh the app. It\u2019s a little annoying, but overall I love the app.","1533":"I love this app sosososo much, but the canvas ad videos don\u2019t work. I\u2019ve tried resetting my phone, resetting my WiFi, deleting and getting webtoon back, and even on different devices. None of it works. I don\u2019t mind the ads, because I get to support my favorite comics like That Awkward Magic (go read it it\u2019s AMAZING), but I can\u2019t support them if the ad doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d just like to see an update on the ads so I can support amazing artists. Thank you for reading.","1534":"Ok I love y\u2019all with all my heart at webtoon.. but I love reading my 18+ content more! Webtoon was an amazing platform before you decided to add the new policy and it\u2019s getting SUPER annoying to be reading my favorite comic or use a fast pass and end up getting an apology saying something along the lines of \u201cthanks to webtoons policy we can\u2019t showcase this episode\u201d\nLike i understand it may be important to keep it kid friendly or whatever but like can we have some way to read this explicit content? Like putting in an email address?","1535":"I love the app, it really is awesome how the art is done and super intriguing to read but recently I\u2019ve been trying to buy coins and the transaction won\u2019t go through even though it said I already bought it which is weird cause I always wait to see if it goes through. If anybody can help me get the coins that I spent $8 on then that would be great but until then I can\u2019t read.","1536":"As said in the title it\u2019s a great app but I have one problem when I spent a lot of money on fast passes ( not that much only like 8$ but still) I was in high hopes that the ones that I fast passed and the new episodes just opened to the people who pay like me.\nI guess it\u2019s not that much but I was I little disappointed that is happens but it\u2019s okay I can live with it. :3","1537":"The series are amazing and the graphics totally rock! I love all the cool challenges that occasionally pop up and I live for the Slice Of Life section. The only thing is I love to read this at night and I wish it had a dark mode!!! That would take this app over the top for amazingness. If you guys could some how work that Ik that would be totally awesome! #DarkModeWebtoon2019\n\nLove you guys \u2661","1538":"I have had this app for a long time, and I have read stories before the introduction of your coin system. I loved this app for the freedom of getting to read as much as you want, without having to spend money, that\u2019s what made this app different and better than the rest. I find myself not wanting to read on this app anymore because of it, despite that fact that a lot of the stories are amazing.","1539":"It\u2019s great, no problems from me. Just a few ideas. First for making WEBTOONs, I don\u2019t want to draw it else where, download it and then upload it. Can you please add the option to draw it on the website or in the app? Also I don\u2019t like having to go to my laptop to make a comic. Can you make it possible to make a WEBTOON on the mobile app?","1540":"I really love Webtoon. I gives me comics I can read and you can subscribe for a notification when the author updates the comic. So, I was reading Let's play on Webtoon and it said I needed coins to move on so I purchased some coins and they didn't come after a couple days. Now like 2-3 weeks later the coins still aren't there and I'm getting a little annoyed that they still have not come in.","1541":"I love the app, it\u2019s set up, and its creators, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the new update it\u2019s just whenever I\u2019m reading a comic whenever I get to the end or in the middle of one, it\u2019ll freeze the app. I can\u2019t go back, even when I restart it. I have to wait like five minutes before going back and trying again only for it to happen once more...","1542":"I find webtoon extremely interesting and the kind of app that you can get stuck on for hours when you\u2019re reading the right comics. I get VERY engaged in the comics and they\u2019re super amusing. I recommend this app 100% and even for the non-readers out there. There is a 99.9% chance that you will find something you will love on this app. Barely any ads and SUPER DUPER FUN!","1543":"I really like WEBTOON and the content it offers, the only thing is you can\u2019t go in and change your email, at least not to my knowledge. When I first started using WEBTOON, I used an old email that I don\u2019t use anymore, but I can\u2019t switch it to my current one. The fact that you can change your password and not your email frustrates me.","1544":"Sorry well, what I mean by that I.... screenshot one of the comics I have been reading aaaand.... I saw this thing come up that said it is illegal and I got surprised... sooo I went at the top of the comic and it said that screenshooting the upcoming comic and sharing it is illegal and i quickly deleted it.... so I will never do it again only when the comic uploads every Wednesday.. sorry, my apologies\n\n  Sincerely, MillieTheCoyote","1545":"I love webtoon it\u2019s a daily relaxation for me. The only things I don\u2019t like about it is that every time I log in through the website or download and delete the app again it never saves where I am so I have to go looking through to find out where I stopped. If they could fix this it would be so helpful for many of the readers. Thanks!","1546":"I have had this app for a couple months now and I don't think I have gone a single day without reading something from it. I love to read and I ran out of paper book to read but this app has so many different stories you can choose I am never bored. This is my number one go to when I am bored or don't have anything going on.","1547":"EDIT: it got fixed!! :) thank you!!! <3\n\nI love the app but the music sound background is not working on my iPhone 6 S Plus. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it\u2019s still not working.. :\u2019( I would love it if I could hear the music that goes along with the WEBTOON I\u2019m reading on my iPhone. Please fix this bug.. :( thank you!! <3","1548":"Webtoon are comics that people get to enjoy form the internet the most comic I like is down to earth I loved it so much that I finished all of the ep. in 6 hours lol. I recommend everyone to download webtoon great comics and I LOVE romance \u2661\ufe0e If the developer sees this can you tell the owner of the comic \u201cDown to earth\u201d that her comics are wonderful! Thank you for ready this! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c","1549":"It\u2019s an amazing app to read webtoons but I\u2019ve been noticing some of the fan translations have disappeared from the library, like for example, the Spanish translation for God Of Highschool isn\u2019t available anymore which is a real shame cause I wanted to share said webtoon with a few of my Spanish speaking friends, is it some sort of glitch or were the translations really removed from the app???","1550":"I love this app I probably spend most of my time on it the content is very good and I definitely would recommend this app to someone but if there was one thing I could change would be about how recently they put fastpass things on completed stories it was a little annoying but overall I love this app.","1551":"I wish that when you would read the new comment that they posted it will it say up anymore so than you would know that you read it and you don\u2019t have to keep on clicking it being like \u201coh they posted again\u201d","1552":"We wait years to for a WEBTOON to finish just so we have to wait even longer? I don\u2019t mind fast pass, that\u2019s a separate and beneficial feature (aside from getting stuck in a loop of paying because otherwise you\u2019d have to wait a month). Seriously though, this is the worse feature you guys have added. WEBTOON used to be a user friendly app that cared, now it\u2019s become all about coins and paying to read.","1553":"Ok, yall really need to do something about all the links in the comments. They obviously lead to inappropriate stuff and there are a lot of young readers!!! Nobody should be allowed to put links unless its the author. Other than that i think this app is great! \nOn a side note, could you please stop sending notifications for webtoons that have spoilers in them?!?","1554":"First off this app is amazing! I\u2019m a creator on the app and people are so nice. Buuuut whenever I like or dislike a comment it doesn\u2019t register. If there were no likes before on a comment and I like it, the thumbs up turns green, but it still says zero likes. Please fix this soon... I feel bad when I can\u2019t like my followers\u2019 comments.","1555":"Hi love it so much, but editors there\u2019s been a lot of problems with the ads recently. And it\u2019s not just me so many people are in the comments saying the same thing. \nThe ads aren\u2019t working and then we can\u2019t see the new episode. \nI really want to support the author and watch the ads but I can\u2019t do either:( \nPlease fix this some how \nThanks","1556":"I tried logging in but couldn\u2019t get in until I signed in with the line chat app and after I did all my comments, hearts on chapters and subscriptions were wiped. Even though everything was wiped I could still see all of my recents so I was able to add some of them back but it was really tedious considering how many webtoons I was subscribed to.","1557":"I understand there being ads to support our creators but sometimes mine won\u2019t load and it frustrates me. The one before that may load perfectly fine but it\u2019s always the one after. I\u2019ve tried closing the app and retrying it over and over again but it won\u2019t work. It makes it really hard to enjoy the comic i\u2019m reading. Most of the time I might just leave the app due to being frustrated. Please fix this.","1558":"I\u2019ve used this app for years and have never had a problem with it until this new update. I\u2019m real cool with watching the ads since they help support the creators but what\u2019s the point of them if it\u2019s not even going to work. I\u2019ve o my had the ads work twice and after that I get a message saying to try again later every freaking time. Please fix it I\u2019d like to be able to support the artists.","1559":"I have been using the app for nearly 2 years now, it\u2019s great, but recently it has gone downhill. I read a bunch of webtoons to pass the time, now they\u2019ve added the fast past and the daily pass. Wut? if you want to read old webtoons you have to pay to read (using coins). DUMB, or simply wait for the next daily pass. Seems greedy to me. It\u2019s a great way to read some amazing toons, but this whole \u201cpay to play\u201d ordeal has ruined it for me, they follow what other corporations have done in order to squeeze as much money out of the consumer. It\u2019s an iffy app at this point.","1560":"I had WEBTOON for around 10 years already but the minor set back is that I would have to delete it and and then re-download it because after around 3 years it just tells me to reload then I try to reload and it won\u2019t work this has also happened to my sister but Hers go back to normal while mines I have to delete but even so I love the comics especially cursed princess club","1561":"I have had this app for many years and absolutely adored it. But the daily pass really needs to stop. It\u2019s frustrating and kind of unfair because it\u2019s on completed comics and sometimes I really want to go back and read bastard, and I forgot where I left off, so sometimes I have to skip through episodes. I can\u2019t do that with daily passes and it\u2019s really making me sad. I can\u2019t be the only one not happy about this. But all I ask is to fix or stop this. I rather spend money on the merch 100%","1562":"I love this game but the only thing I don\u2019t like is that when the author has a page not publish and you want to see it you have to pay for coins just to see the next episode but I think it\u2019s an amazing app I like how you can comment things after your done reading the story I overall think you should get this game","1563":"I love Webtoons. The only problem I have is with the fast pass. All I want to do is to read my subscribed comics and immerse myself in the story. But I am continuously stopped by fastpass. I don\u2019t have money to spend on apps. Webtoons is a FREE app. So why do we have to pay to read some of the episodes? That\u2019s just really irritating. Other than that I think the app is fine as a whole. I just HATE the fast pass.","1564":"I\u2019ve had this app for a few months now, and I\u2019m always looking forward to the stories I read! It\u2019s such an amazing app and it will definitely get you attached to it! I literally spent days reading an entire story until I got caught up and now I\u2019m obsessed with it. Y\u2019all should really try it out! It won\u2019t be a waste of time I promise!","1565":"Right now when I open the WEBTOON app it says that there is no internet connection, but my wifi is working perfectly fine. This has happened before so I just deleted and reinstalled the app, but I don\u2019t want to do that again because I don\u2019t want to lose track of what I\u2019ve already read.","1566":"So I recently downloaded WEBTOON. It\u2019s a very fun app and I love the stories on the app! It was amazing until I made an account and it said it sent me an e-mail to verify my account but I never received the e-mail. I am very upset because this has occurred, I was hoping so subscribe to a few stories and buy coins but I can not do that. Yes, you may be thinking that I could put in my e-mail again but it says that it is already in use. I hope you can fix this bug soon and thank you for the attention of this matter.","1567":"Hello developers! I\u2019m sure no one is gonna read this but my webtoon screen is way to small.. I read webtoon on an iPad and the screen used to be zoomed in good enough but now it\u2019s so far away and I hate it! Please fix it I liked it better before... it makes me sad that it won\u2019t be comfortable to read webtoon anymore.. thank you..","1568":"I LOVE this app very much I would recommend!\nBUT I wish there was a better system for getting coins. Not all of us are adults making money, so sometimes I wish I could just read new chapters with out getting coins with REAL MONEY there is no other option.\nI wish you could change it so if I wanted free coins I could watch an ad or write a review on a comic or anything that dousing require real money.","1569":"Okay so this app is absolutely fantastic all around, but there\u2019s one thing that really bugs me. I signed up just fine, however, when my friend tried to do the same thing, it didn\u2019t work. We tried a lot of things and it just wouldn\u2019t let her make an account which I thought to be pretty aggravating. Is there a fix to this? It\u2019d be appreciated.","1570":"So now WebToons is doing the coins crap like WebComics.  There are ads on WebToons so why the coin system and fast pass stuff?  Not everyone(especially high school or college students)has extra money to spend on stuff.  Sure, it may be $2.99 here and $4.99 there, but things add up.  If one pays for \u201cFast Pass\u201d coins will the comics be ad-free?  \nAlso, are the artists\/authors still going to be able to ask if readers want to sign up for their Patreon?  \nIrritating...","1571":"Absolutely amazing app. Everything is great about it except for one MAJOR thing. I'm sure others have asked but is there ever going to be an update where we can create on mobile devices. I love this app but I have been wanting to write and share but its impossible to do on mobile devices. I still enjoy reading but i just wish i could create. Please take this into consideration.","1572":"I would usually give webtoon a 5 but ever since this policy has come into play some of my favorite webtoon comics and artists were are being forced to leave to another site. And it\u2019s forced me to go to another site  that forces me to have a lower quality but I will for my comic. I don\u2019t understand why you guys did this but PLEASE TAKE IT DOWN. It\u2019s taking a toll on everyone. I don\u2019t wanna leave webtoon because there are great comics on here but I might have to because of this.","1573":"I\u2019m very sure you have heard of a lot of protests about the new WEBTOONS policy. I really enjoy reading WEBTOON, but the new policy is shutting down a lot of the comics or forcing the creators to make huge changes to their story and it is hard for them. I really dislike the new policy for taking down a lot of WEBTOON that a lot of people enjoy and not all users on WEBTOON is underage for reading mature webtoons. A lot of users dislike the right of being able to read mature webtoons taken away from them. I want you take our opinions for consideration and revoke the new policy.","1574":"Webtoon has a huge contest going on at the moment. They've implemented new guidelines for their site that pretty much kills the BL genre just to keep these stories from getting anywhere near that top prize. Putting that much restraint over artistic narrative shouldn't target one group- shove your full frontal stuff- we all know you put that there as an afterthought. Leave the in depth parenting where it belongs; they should know what their children are doing. You've become a joke to me, and not in a good way. I've killed the application and have actively asked my friends to do the same.","1575":"i loved this app so freaking much because of all of the talented creators and the incredible comics made. but ever since webtoon added the daily pass on the completed series its really hindered my love for the app. i dont have the patience nor the money to have to wait weeks or even months just to reread a beloved series. i understand that the daily pass is to help creators but it just doesnt make sense to use. plus most users of this app are teens or young adults who probably dont have a lot of their own money to spend. this app was the best because you were able to read all of rhe comics with no hinderances or passes. i think the implementation of daily passes are going to be the downfall of this app.","1576":"Webtoon is such a good resource\u2014 it allows artists everywhere to share their stories and get paid, but users don\u2019t have to watch ads or pay for any comics. People who complain about this are forgetting that users have access to unlimited comics for free and artists are getting paid. A lot of the artwork is stunning and so many stories are beautiful.","1577":"I've had this app for a long time and I have to say this is one of my favorite apps, and I dont have many. \nI especially love the new up date, I could look for new webtoons Easier than it was before. This app has good webtoons and almost every genre you could think of. I totally recommend this app, it pleases me that I could find an app like this.","1578":"I\u2019ve been on this app for over 2 years and I really hate to see this app grow into they way it has now... daily passes means you can only read 1-3 episodes a day!!THATS INSANE!!! Especially when the comic is done, and it have HUNDREDS of episodes... I RATHER NOT WAIT DAYS JUST TO READ ONE EPISODE. That\u2019s not worth it in my opinion and even if I do spend money on these episodes the daily passes only make it so you unlock the episode for 13 days... so what be the point spending money for it if I can\u2019t even keep it?! Shame on you WEBTOON... :\/","1579":"I love this app so much but the only problem is you have to pay for coins. I like that it gives you a chance to see the next episode but I don\u2019t like having to pay money for the coins. Overall GREAT app!!! \u2764\ufe0f I totally recommend it! Even if you don\u2019t like to read this app gives you all the best things like drama, romance, comedy, BL, GL, and so much more!!\n-Icepup66","1580":"The numbers at the bottom made Webtoons feel more like a comic store than some random app and helped to keep track cause it\u2019s hard to find where you stopped reading. Also it\u2019s easier to focus on a number than multiple moving words at the top of a screen when you have astigmatism. \n\nAstigmatism- an eye deformity that makes all light blurry and can cause headaches.","1581":"When I first installed WEBTOON I had no issues, though I think the fast pass is annoying ( like I would love it even more if it only cost money once) then about 5 or so months into the app I experienced issues I could no longer buy coins, (I use family sharing) I tried uninstalling then reinstalling, logging out and I wouldn\u2019t work... please help, I\u2019m going crazy.","1582":"The functionality and concept of the app is great. However, I explored it very little due to the low security on the app. The password a user has is limited to 16 characters, and for security purposes I use longer passwords than that. I do not want my information to be compromised because of this app, and therefore deleted my account and uninstalled the app. Would be great to see the app improve security for the sake of the users, especially since so many people reuse passwords so this low level of protection can compromise the other accounts a person may hold.","1583":"10\/10 app isn\u2019t pay to read the creators have a chance to make money via in app purchases but it\u2019s not forced upon you its a choice to support your favorite creators and the story\u2019s on the app are amazeing  there\u2019s something for everybody have yet to read a bad one 10\/10 absolutely recommend to anyone who enjoys reading or comics","1584":"I love this app!! There\u2019s so many stories that I am currently reading which makes it a little easier to wait for new episodes since I\u2019m reading so many at the same time. However, I\u2019m so disappointed right now. Ever since the app update yesterday I have not been able to open the app. It crashes every time I try to open it. I hope there\u2019s another update soon to fix this. All of my other apps open fine. :(","1585":"I love Webtoon. It\u2019s amazing. But for some reason every time I try to get into the app it goes straight back to the home screen! I shut my phone off,  deleted and downloaded it multiple times and tried to change the internet. Nothing worked. Does anyone else have the same problems I do?","1586":"So a glitch occurred 2 minutes ago when I went to a fresh new chapter of \u201ctrue beauty\u201d it automatically said \u201cunable to connect to the network. Please check the internet connection.\u201d And my internet is fine I even tested it out on every other game I have it works perfect please fix this I love your app though it\u2019s so good. I love the stories, but please do fix this. Thank you so much!\u2764\ufe0f","1587":"I don\u2019t remember the exact details but I did the summer reading challenge thing for hooky (great story I love it) and it said something along the lines of \u2018congratulations you qualify for 15 free coins! Thank you for participating!\u2019 But I\u2019ve been waiting for a while and I\u2019m disappointed that I still haven\u2019t gotten the coins... \nnow I don\u2019t know the exact details because I don\u2019t completely remember so do correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I\u2019m just upset that I didn\u2019t get what I was promised. Other than that great app. I love all the stories.","1588":"this app is literally amazing! I\u2019ve had it for at least 2 years and I still really like it. however, recently, I\u2019ve been having an issue where I\u2019m reading a story and mid-way through, the app would just freeze, causing me to relaunch it again. upon reading other reviews, im not the only one who\u2019s has this issue. please fix this issue! thank you.","1589":"I really, really, reallyyyy love this app, it has amazing stories that will make you want to read more of. There\u2019s only one thing I don\u2019t like, and that\u2019s having to wait more than 20 days just to read another episode\/ story, in that time I could potentially forget about this app, so is there anyway to lessen the time wait ?","1590":"I don\u2019t really hate this app because it has amazing comics and other ones too. But the only problem I have is that when u want to read the newest comic you have to pay for it with coins! I\u2019m really frustrated because like why do I need to buy coins if I can just watch a video or add for it not buy it and another thing is the wait why do we have to wait until the comics are free like wth like for example lore Olympics I have to wait 40 day until it\u2019s finally free like I hate this sooo sooo sooo much","1591":"I love this app. It really is great, but it  could be better. I only have 2 complaints. One of them is that I can\u2019t download chapters in the background. I have to stay in that screen. Also, if I downloaded something and I go back into this app, it will act like it\u2019s loading again when it should have been downloaded.","1592":"I absolutely loveeee this app and what it allows for aspiring comic authors and such. The stories are fun and amazing! Since I\u2019m a fujoshi and highly like nfsw things, it\u2019s been painful to read the author\u2019s notes talking about how they can\u2019t publish nfsw anymore. Some WEBTOONs I read are mainly nfsw and it\u2019s sad to see the main focus of the comic be shot down. I still love the app and all...but please..maybe consider changing the policy back..? Just an idea and I hope I speak for a lot of people out there who like nfsw stuff lul","1593":"I absolutely love webtoons. I live on them ,but the new update that bans all NSFW is not my thing. The warning that tells people that it is mature content should be enough. If other people are complaining about mature content for younger viewers, they should take into account that warning banners are given every time there is mature content . This ban is especially unfair to creators who has quite a bit of mature content because they have to delete all the episodes which can accumulate to a large amount of their comic. Overall I think webtoons should change its mature content ban.","1594":"Let me start off by saying that I completely understand why a policy like this is in place; But I also do not believe that this policy is beneficial for the future of this app or the writers and creators who use it to release their creations into the world. I and many others who are of legal age enjoy the more adult comics and all that that entails but this new policy makes it so some of our favorite authors and illustrators cannot post their content without fear of it being removed. In conclusion, the app was perfect before and this policy will drive away both readers and creators to other services.","1595":"This app is by far the best for comics\/manga. Easy navigation, chapter update alerts, and of course the interactive community of commenters & readers. The art is amazing and the amount of comics is endless. I love that people have the opportunity to join in and add comics, watching artists grow on webtoon is truly an exceptional experience! Thank you Webtoon and thank you to the fanbase fam for making this app so great (:","1596":"I love it but the thing I hate is that when u go more forward to the stories ur going to have to start waiting like days or one day so u can see the story and really hope they will change that cause I love reading the stories and I have to wait for 3 stories to be unlocked\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude29","1597":"It was a great app but now I can not sign in to my account I have tried and tried numerous times and have waited for one week. I have lost all my coins and I keep trying. I would have given this five stars if it were not for this problem. Before this it also frequently signed me out I do not suggest this app for anyone who gets frustrated easily. I tried this on my numerous devices and it did not work. I suggest just reading from a real book if this keeps happening \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude22","1598":"Webtoon are great, and I have no problem spending money on coins every now and then for unfinished series. But a daily pass for COMPLETED series are where I draw the line. I purposefully try not to read chapters so I can binge read 2-3 at a time. Webtoons arent all created equally length-wise. Shorter chapters tend to update faster than longer ones. This makes it completely unfair to slap a daily 1 free pass on completed series. Webtoons, you need to come up with a better solution to the daily pass situation.","1599":"I absolutely love Webtoon. It is a great app that I use daily. However, I\u2019m not too fond about the daily pass. It now has to end as a cliff hanger until I have to wait a few more days to read it for free. Therefore, I must wait until I can read the next episode. I\u2019m sorry but I cannot handle that, for I am an impatient person. But other then the fact the daily pass is ruining the vibe and keeping it as a cliffhanger, this app is very good.","1600":"I did a challenge for the coins, they didn\u2019t give me any of them! I am really disappointed and sad that I couldn\u2019t get fast pass ( or whatever it\u2019s called) \nEvery else is very good and I read a bunch of stories on there! But I\u2019m sad about the coins....\n\nEdit: IT HAPPENED AGAIN I got 30 free coins and I used 10 of them and suddenly they all disappeared I am super disappointed.","1601":"I absolutely love this app but recently it\u2019s been glitching a whole lot. I haven\u2019t been able to open it for a day or two. When I\u2019d open the app, the images wouldn\u2019t load completely and neither the comics and most of the features on the app itself. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it but that didn\u2019t help. I hope you guys can fix this glitch soon :)","1602":"After the most recent update to fix any \u2018minor bug errors\u2019 the app will no longer load for me. I have been using the app very frequently(every day, multiple times a day) and I love it. However, since this most recent update whenever I select the app it immediately crashes. I tried to reinstall and restart my phone but that has not worked. Glad to see an update to fix \u2018minor bug errors\u2019 caused a very big error.","1603":"I love this app and I\u2019ve read amazing stories on it for years, however they are starting to add, or have already added a system where you have to watch an ad In order to read the next chapter of a story which is incredibly upsetting and makes for an over all unpleasant experience. If you\u2019re wanting to start reading webcomics like those on this platform just go to tapas, they\u2019re not making awful changes like this one","1604":"It\u2019s a good app I enjoy using it, but they just started a read everyday challenge and it has started me over 3 times already. I couldn\u2019t find a link to send feedback so I\u2019m leaving my comment here. The challenges don\u2019t seem to be working properly (and trust me I know I\u2019ve checked in everyday) I should already have 9 days in if it didn\u2019t keep starting me over.","1605":"I don\u2019t have that much issues with this app at all. Matter fact, I love this app.  But it acts slow and glitches to where I can\u2019t read anything sometimes . I\u2019ve refreshed multiple times thinking that it would solve it but nothing else worked. The other apps on my phone works so it\u2019s just this one that\u2019s acting up. \n       ~ Please fix it. All of my favorite stories have updated and I really want to read them \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffe.","1606":"I LOVE WEBTOON!!!! It is an amazing app and I love the comics like True beauty and lore Olympus. Their is just ONE problem. It continues to freeze up. I don\u2019t know why it keeps happening but it does and gets me mad. I hate making a bad review because this app is by far, my most used app! It\u2019s just it won\u2019t load properly or it just doesn\u2019t load in general. I love the app and would give it a 4.5 star rating if I knew how.\n\n-Justice","1607":"The stories are very interesting and addicting. I don\u2019t use this app because it would take hours of my time. Lore Olympus was surprisingly really really good. The art and the stories are phenomenal! The app is also very easy to use. Super enjoyable app, but if you\u2019re anything like me you\u2019re gonna waste precious time of your life on this app ;)","1608":"The app is awesome and I\u2019ve had great experience with it! The stories are amazing and I love how you can also make some stories as well!(it\u2019s a little complicated.. the app if filled with awesome most nicest drawers p\/editors! I recommend for the people that wanna try this but are hesitant, Don\u2019t worry! This app is safe awesome and when you read the stories you want more!","1609":"Nearly a week ago I tried to purchase coins so I could support my favorite artist on here, and I never received them even though I paid and the money had been withdrawn from my account. I contacted customer service many times about it over multiple days and they ended up just never coming back to me. The coins were never put into my account and the money was never refunded either. Id like to say I love this app, but the customer service really ruins it for me.","1610":"When I first got this app I did not like reading and I thought it would be like the rest of those boring book app, however I loved almost all of the comics!! My favorites were Edith and Lore Olympus\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 I was so emotional over Edith because some of these stories are relatable. I hope several other people download this app to experience a truly great reading app.","1611":"So I love this app! But lately I\u2019ve been getting notifications that so and so has updated but when I try and read it, it shows that nothing has updated in the past week. None of the series I read will update even though it says they have and I can\u2019t read anything \ud83d\ude2b please help because I can\u2019t download them to read either.","1612":"I love this and even though I am giving it 5 stars it has been giving me some problems lately. I will be reading but then the app will freeze. This only happens with WEBTOON so I doubt it\u2019s  just my phone. Still WEBTOON is a great app so I would still recommend it. (Oh and be careful what you click on, if something is like 18+ there is a good reason)","1613":"I love webtoon but the new feature, fast pass, is kind of annoying because the top comments is always filled up with comments that used fast pass. A solution to this is to just take out the comment feature to fast pass to create a fair chance for everybody. If they changed the this I would definitely give them 5 stars.","1614":"Webtoon is a great app to get on when given free time, riding the train, or even right before going to bed. The different toons are entertaining and tasteful, there\u2019s a webcomic for just about everyone. I do love this app but, the pop up ads are kind of getting in the way and the ridding of tapping the bottom of the screen to continue is kind of annoying as well. But over all it\u2019s a great app and the best part is that it\u2019s FREE!","1615":"Being that authors can no longer post 18+ content, it\u2019s bringing both creators and readers away from the app. Now both will probably turn to somewhere else like Tapas. When I got a notice from one of my comics, it said they won\u2019t continue the story because of the new policy. Sure there are young readers out there but there are also the readers who would want to 18+ content. Being said I\u2019m now turning to Tapas for all my comics, even though some of them cost money... I\u2019m still willing enough to buy them instead of not being to experience an authors story...","1616":"Webtoon was amazing. I really loved it, until they updated their new policy. Their new policy is no penetration, mention of sex, or even censorships. Nothing at all. Many creators had to delete their comics or move their comic to a different app, and readers are also going to different apps instead of Webtoon. Many people have complained about it. Other people, including myself absolutely HATE this policy. Everyone wants to change this policy, and bring it back to the way it used to. Webtoon is losing people because of this update.","1617":"So I loved Webtoons and have been a daily reader for a very long time. I\u2019m no person to judge on what a person likes to draw so I do read many BLs and many many haters are reporting webcomics due to 18+ scenes although they follow all the guidelines. For example, putting the notification when clicking on the series to read it asks if you are 18 or older and also censoring specific scenes. And webtoons bluntly just removes scenes that shouldn\u2019t be removed and with the new guidelines prohibited scenes even if censored. MANY others such as myself are furious over this.","1618":"Alright, let\u2019s just start off saying that this is the best comic app I\u2019ve seen in my life. There are no ads, no  need to pay money and all of this is for free. I have no words... :) The only bad part is when you are up to date with your favorite comic and you have to wait a week for it to upload another episode:( However, I love this app!","1619":"I used to like webtoon but ever since they bought Wattpad this is my most disliked app ever y'all should\u2019ve just minded y'all business stop trying to make everything kid friendly. Wattpad is not for kids and it will never be. Wattpad will loose all of there viewers so yall basically just wasted your money. Kids like books with pictures in it and wattpad is just not that. Very upsetting. There are wattpad authors whose wonderful work is getting removed because its mature. They spent all that time on books to have it removed because its not \u201c kid friendly\u201d. You guys are ruining everything.","1620":"Love the WEBTOON app and have never had problems before, but a couple of days ago, the app has been incredibly slow and not loading episodes, so I can\u2019t even read any of my fav series when they update :( I thought perhaps it was my wifi, but all of my other apps work fine and a lot of reviews say the same thing , please fix the app soon","1621":"Is it just me or is anyone else kinda annoyed that WEBTOON shows fast pass notifications cuz it\u2019s basically spoilers. It\u2019ll just say what happens in a fast past episode and I think it\u2019s kinda annoying since most ppl cant afford coins to use and we just have to wait weeks to read an episode.","1622":"I love WEBTOON sooo much I am reading freaking romance and phase right now. But I paid the get more episodes unlocked and then the next day another episode is mad but it is money again. It is literally sooo much money to get more episodes. I broke down in tears because I loved the books I was reading so much but it wouldn\u2019t let me watch anymore episodes because I have to pay... I am so upset on how expensive this is.\ud83d\ude22","1623":"WEBTOON is a wonderful app and it alerts you when a comic is ready each week. If you want to support authors you can use fast pass and get the next episode a week early. \n\nRemember- these are real people writing these comics, a week per episode is impressive. Overall this app is great and has a lot of interesting content!","1624":"I love this app a lot of interesting titles my favorite being Unordinary but I paid for the coins and I regret it because it doesn\u2019t keep you ahead on the story it just makes it so u have to either constantly buy coins or wait even longer for the new free episode to come out so o just feel ripped off with the $5 purchase other than that amazing app","1625":"I love Webtoons, literally spent like 8 dollars to read my fav series.  I accidentally screenshot the page when I was taking off my iPhone cover.  It was one from the fast pass and I deleted it right after cause I know it\u2019s illegal to do that \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d So yeah I don\u2019t know how to send a message to the developer and or the Webtoon people so I hope y\u2019all see this","1626":"This app has some amazing content on it and I love all the talented artists and what they do. However recently when I open a new comic I often get an ad that will take up the top third of the screen, not only is this annoying and can make it difficult to read the first panels of the comic, it also makes it impossible to navigate to a new comic once I\u2019ve finished reading because it covers the back button!","1627":"There is this glitch on when there is an ad at the end it immediately takes you to the website and if you try to get back in the app it keeps doing it over again and again. Please fix this. Overall the app is awesome and I don\u2019t regret getting it","1628":"So my favorite BL is not on there which made me very sad cuz I need my BL and webtoon is the only app my mother allows so I\u2019m just wondering maybe you can change the policy back to normal where we can read the beautiful BL and not have the other people\u2019s favorite BL get put down OwO I will be praying to god that you will put back some of the BL comic T.T","1629":"I LOVE THIS APP the only problem with it is the coins. I\u2019m okay with the system and things and you might need to wait a while. But there should be a way to GET FREE COINS, IT EVEN SAYS IT IN THE SETTINGS AREA, FREE COINS. There should at least be a way. Like 1 coin per episode, or every 10 episodes depending on how big that episode was. I think this would be a GREAT thing if it was added to the app","1630":"Ok, so WEBTOONs was the one thing that helped me relax after a busy schedule and it still is... but I don\u2019t like the fact that I need to wait 10 days after it\u2019s already out...just for the new episodes. Like right now one of my favorites Webtoons has 3 new episodes out, but I need to pay for coins just to read it. Hints why I put 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","1631":"I like to enjoy my own playlists while I read this used to not be a problem till now everytime I open the app it immediately stops my music its kinda annoying would appreciate the fix other than that the app works great the WEBTOON team is really good on accommodating the best experience for its readers","1632":"Webtoon comics is very entertaining and have stories that you get addicted to and cant stop reading.  The thing i love most is how the authors of the comics leave you in suspense and  makes you so anxious about the characters and is so good they even make you feel for the characters.  Get the app and you all will understand how good this app is.  Trust me.","1633":"Webtoon is really good and I love it cause it\u2019s a place where I can read all my favorite comics but lately my webtoon has been acting weirdly and not working like right now whenever I open the webtoon app it\u2019s on the webtoon logo with the green screen but it closed the app and took me to my home screen and I keep trying to open and read my comics but it just waits a minute and takes me back to my home screen","1634":"This app is amazing, however, there is a major flaw that I have experienced. I have a very strong internet connection but cannot seem to log in. I\u2019ve created an account, verified it, then attempted logging in to no prevail. If I do succeed after re-installing, it does not help the issue. I have also tried turning my phone off and on, and plugged it in as well. Let\u2019s hope this works!","1635":"I have been using WEBTOON for over a few months now and I have been extraordinarily delighted every day I read it. I would recommend this App to anyone-(trust me you\u2019ll like at least a million of the stories in this app), I would like to conclude that the only mistake this app has is it\u2019s maturity limit.\n\nP.S- Read I love Yoo, and  Age Matters( their Absolutely Delightful Stories","1636":"I really like this app but there\u2019s this one problem. It\u2019s been working great until it won\u2019t let me out of the app. I wouldn\u2019t let me do anything. I couldn\u2019t turn down my music, turn off my phone, get out of the app, etc..  I even tried to shut off my phone completely and I couldn\u2019t even do that. I was only allowed to get out of the story and move the pages up and down but even that would glitch. Please fix this.","1637":"I love this app! It has great stories and authors, keeps me entertained all day long. But for some reason ever since a few \u201cupdates\u201d ago, it\u2019ll freeze up until I do another update and be fine for a few days but then I have to repeat the process all over again! It\u2019s annoying and it needs to be fixed!! Thanks would give a 5 star rating but can\u2019t read anything since it\u2019s freezes up \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","1638":"I love webtoons but their new policy has made me a bit disappointed. Webtoon has taken away all mature content when they already established that it must be censored for younger viewers. I agree with this but so many great comic artists have either deleted their old comic and started fresh or just took it away in all and just left it unfinished. Webtoon has taken away comics from their authors and that to me us equivalent to taking a child away from thier parents. I really hope that they notice this and take action. Also why the limit on subscriptions????","1639":"I have been using this app for a couple of years at least and I spend a lot of time on it since I have found wonderful comics to read while on my way to work and back home. Their constant improvement and easy navigation make it even more lovable to me. Definitely a must have!","1640":"Webtoon is by far one of my favorite apps. it\u2019s has my favorite comics and i found many comics i loved reading. Unfortunately later on, when i found completed comics, there was a daily pass. I was very bummed out by this. I would like to enjoy the completed comics without a daily pass. Other than that, the app is great and would recommend.","1641":"When I first downloaded the app I read unordinary until sunrise and I love that it introduced me to this form of media. However now every time I open the app to read the new edition of one of my subscribed webtoons, it will play an ad and no matter what I do if I close it, minimize, or just let the ad play it always ends up crashing. This is so annoying because it\u2019ll crash then I\u2019ll open it back up again and the same thing happens every time. So just for that huge problem I have to give it 1 star.","1642":"I have been an avid user of this app for months now and have enjoyed all the things it can offer. I was using an iPhone 6 and when I switched to an iPhone 8+, I\u2019ve started getting these ads. However, that\u2019s not the problem. I don\u2019t mind ads but after the ads show after I click on the chapters\/pages, they freeze the page and the app crashes. I open the app again and the same thing happens when I click on a chapter making me unable to not read anything at all. Please fix this bug please!","1643":"So I\u2019ve used WEBTOON for a while now and I loved it so far, but recently there is an ad that keeps popping up on my screen when I\u2019m trying to read. It doesn\u2019t matter what story I go to it keeps popping up and then the app force closes when I try to cut the ad off. Please fix this because if it doesn\u2019t get fixed I\u2019m going have to delete the app. There is no point to having WEBTOON if I can\u2019t read a story without the app closing while I\u2019m reading.","1644":"I participated in the WEBTOONs free coin events and I earned 28 free coins, but I didn\u2019t spend any of my coins yet it says that balance is now 0 when I remember just last month that I had 28 coins that I earned. Don\u2019t get me wrong this one of my favorite apps on my phone and I love the diversity of the genres that they offer. My only problem is where have my coins (that I planned to use) gone?","1645":"Maybe it\u2019s my phone (iPhone 6s) but it takes a while to start up and it takes a long time to respond when I click on the comics or the search button\nI also use tapas and it\u2019s way less buggy so can you make it better \nTapas is also way faster than Webtoon \nPlease fix\n4 stars because it has great stories but very laggy","1646":"I have had this app for about a week and all of the sudden it is completely unusable. I\u2019m really sad about it because I found a few comics I really liked! It crashes before I can even see the home page and I have no idea how to fix it. This is happening on iPhone 7. I\u2019ve even deleted and re-downloaded the app. Nothing has helped.","1647":"I\u2019ve had this app for 4 almost 5 years. No doubt in my mind I love this app, the stores, authors, and even all the other users that use this app. BUT! I simply cannot get bring the Daily Pass system. It\u2019s ineffective and serves as a deterrent to complete stories that use it. There are a lot of users cannot afford to spend money and there are also the authors that rely on this for a source of income but the Daily Pass is not the way to go. Hopefully someone on the WEBTOON\/NAVAR team sees this and can understand the feeling that me and other users feel.","1648":"it\u2019s a very good app, and the stories are fantastic. however, whenever i open the app i can only click on one or two things at a time without the app shutting down and not allowing me to do anything. i\u2019ve tried uninstalling and redownloading but that doesn\u2019t seem to fix the issues. wonderful app, weird and frustrating issues at time","1649":"The app itself was great, but I was waiting 3 days for a new episode to come out and as soon as it said it will be ready in 4 hours I waited, but then I go to check because I think it\u2019s ready and then it says \u201cready soon\u201d. And it does not even say a specific time or that it should be ready by now. And it says that it will be free soon so not only do I have to wait for it to release, I have to pay for it.","1650":"Okay so I love WEBTOON and have been using it for years but I think there could be something  added to benefit some readers. Not everyone reads with the lights on or in the daytime. I think it would be AMAZING if webtoon imputed a dark theme mode setting because the white backgrounds are too bright sometimes. Other than that, this is a great app! Thank you for reading","1651":"Could people in the world NOT be money grubbing business suits? I would like to read these, read anything, with out having to pay for some kind of monthly pass just to READ. It\u2019s asinine. I\u2019d be more than willing to watch adds every four chapters or something. Putting a restriction on this is incredibly infuriating. Can\u2019t consume any media in chronological order anywhere unless you cough up money. Especially at this time of crisis and panic this is even harder to budget and pay for. Terrible.","1652":"The app is amazing and probably one of the best online comic platforms, but it\u2019s currently not working? I\u2019ve had the app for years but recently the apps been crashing when you click on a comic, settings, etc. The website works fine and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just my type of phone???","1653":"So I\u2019ve noticed today with only canvas that the progress of those webtoons have been removed as if I never read them when they updated a new chapter. I\u2019m sure this is bug but please fix this because I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of a story and then when it updates I lose my progress and forget where I\u2019m at. Thank you and I hope this helps. I love WEBTOONS!","1654":"Currently, whenever I try to open up any of the stories I read, the screen will freeze, be blank a blank slate except a few features, and all the episodes won\u2019t show up. I\u2019ve fully closed the app and shut down my phone, but nothing\u2019s worked yet.","1655":"Everything run perfectly until a month or two ago. Everytime a series has new chapter i have to spend about 15mins of pressing the reload button over and over again just to finish reading it. Enter the series, the slider go unsmooth and lagging as hell. I dont know what are those \"minor improvements\" they did in recently updates for but my experience with the app go down rapidly, it is not worth to keep using the app that have you frustrating and stresses just to read a single chapter of comic","1656":"The app was amazing until the daily pass thing. I\u2019ve read a lot of completed WEBTOONs and it\u2019s upsetting to thing I have to pay to read a comic that I\u2019ve already completed. An example is Orange Marmalade. I read it a few years back and finished and I loved it so much. I wanted to reread it and I can only read 2 episodes a day. I don\u2019t even have money for WEBTOON so it really upsets me about the new policy. I\u2019m only giving stars because the app is good other than daily pass. And I realized that the creator of webtoon doesn\u2019t even read the reviews it\u2019s honestly annoying\ud83d\ude21","1657":"I loooooooooove webtoon, I was obsessed with it actually. I spent over ten dollars on the app for coins. But I ascendantly deleted it\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I thought nothing of it bc of auto log in, but then it was disabled. I got sooooooo sad. I almost cried bc I was so devastated.\nSo, I did what you usually would do in my situation. And that is to contact them. I emailed them THREE TIMES. And I never got a reply back. Only the auto generated email like \u201cthank you for contacting us. We will help you shortly.\u201d i am really sad to give them one star, but I spent my hard earned money on this. I would\u2019ve gave them five. :(","1658":"I love this app it\u2019s so good a lot of good comics to read. But the only problem is that the date is wrong for example if today is Monday WEBTOON will see it as if today is Sunday so it\u2019s a day setup as a day before the actual day.  That\u2019s the only issue I have other than that if I could give it 100 stars I would.","1659":"Yes as cringey as my title might sound, webtoon really is AMAZING for people or tweens like myself that enjoy reading webcomics that are appropriate for their age!!! I loooove how diverse they are with their comics and how amazing the authors art is!!! Plus I love the storylines, such as my favorites \u201cAge matters\u201d \u201cTrue beauty\u201d \u201cits a good day to be a dog\u201d and my ultimate favorite \u201cDAYS OF HANA!!!\u201d So please keep up the good work authors!!! And thank u webtoon for this AMAZING app you have created!!!","1660":"There was an update that impacts a ton of the inspiring authors. It literally impacts them so much that they can't post on there or they have to completely change the story. I don't think that is supportive, and it's restricting others creativity. I come to webtoon everyday and find inspiration and happiness. Some make me laugh, cry, or rage, but it felt different from other comic websites. It's free, and it felt free. It saddens me to see these restrictions.","1661":"I don't see any way to get in contact with the developer but I having trouble with my coins, I know how many I'm supposed to have and I'm showing zero..? I can't understand why? Last time this happened was because  I was logged out. Looked like I was logged out again, so not only did I log back in I also verrifed my email figuring it might be that. And still nothing. I really wouldn't have written a review like this if there was a more direct way to get to the developer \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","1662":"Okay so Webtoon is one of my favorite apps to read on but recently (a few months ago) they started this new thing called flash pass. People keep spoiling the next episode for people. The ones that are using flash pass see that episode that hasn\u2019t been released yet like a month before it\u2019s released. I understand that some artist need the money but that\u2019s what patron is for. At least if you\u2019re gonna use that make a different app for it.","1663":"I really enjoy the variety of content on this app, it\u2019s nice to have something new to read every morning. And the organization of it all, by day or completed, is fun to browse through.\n\nThe real reason I\u2019m leaving a review though is because whoever is in charge of push notifications is killllling ittttt. \u2665\ufe0f Keep up the good work.","1664":"Okay.. this app is amazing so so so fun!!! I can\u2019t stop reading it!!! It\u2019s a little PG but that\u2019s alright there\u2019s nothing really bad about its\nJust so fun!!! All the comics are so interesting and not silly and dumb for one!! I would definitely! Get it! If your  maybe 6-8 I would be a little careful. They do cuss a little but.. That\u2019s kinda all!! Get it it\u2019s amazing!!!","1665":"I LOVE this app SO MUCH, endless reading and content for EVERYONE. It really is amazing but i want to try making a comic myself and I dont really know how,,,also to those who dont like the new policy about NSFW, keep in mind this app was meant for kids 9+ which means that young kids are allowed to read and enjoy this too. So its only natural for it to be more strict about these things.","1666":"It\u2019s me. \u201cISpeakForTheAbs\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u201d and as you can tell by my name, I am a HUGE fan of the Abs. Some of my favorite creators have now lost their freedom to post whatever they like on this app because of the new policy. To be honest, I actually do love this app because it\u2019s free and quite easy to use. But it\u2019s sad to think that some creators may move to a different platform that either costs or has a bad viewing experience. I hope that WEBTOON will take this into consideration because I believe a lot of people are not happy about this. (Sorry if my English sounds jumbled. I speak Spanish \ud83d\ude02)","1667":"So I\u2019ve had this app for awhile now (couple months) and just recently they made this this new announcement about mature\/censored scenes not allowed. Because of this new rule a lot of Web comics are being discontinued. I do hafta say that it was soooo much better before this new rule because most of the most popular comics aren\u2019t aloud to do their regular updates and the episodes they worked really hard on, they now are pretty much being forced to redraw! WEBTOONS!! PLEASE MAKE IT HOW IT WAS BEFORE THIS NEW RULE!!!!","1668":"Many of the stories are so touching and there\u2019s so many talented artists. The only thing that bothers me is that the comics don\u2019t really have a rating of what content could be in a comic. A lot of comics have swearing and scenes so it would be nice if the artists would give a little warning or rating on what it\u2019s in the comics before some chid taps on a inappropriate comic (this app is really for 9+? It should have been 13+!)","1669":"If you are a manga\/comic lover then you will love this app just as much as me. There is NO payment required and NO ads. You can subscribe to a certain title that you like so you can get notified when they update. The art in each webtoon is different and new it\u2019s very inspiring. I love this app and there isn\u2019t much I would change about it. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude0d","1670":"I\u2019ve have been reading comics from Webtoon for about a year now. Webtoon is free and it\u2019s very convenient to just pull out your device. They also have a great selection of comics for you to read to get hooked in the story. Webtoon is a very good app that you can also support the author of the comic that you are reading, which is great!! Thank you so much Webtoon!","1671":"Ok so you have heard this before about daily pass well I hate daily pass like the only reason I got this app is cus my fav comic down to earth but I\u2019m on episode 51 and having to wait for my next episode to unlock and one of the other thing\u2019s i got this app is it helped me read and I never read so please read this and please delete daily pass!!","1672":"I love this app a lot! I\u2019ve been reading on here for years and it\u2019s great, however the daily passes and coin thing has to go. I went to go read My Boo since it\u2019s one of my favorites and I saw that I would have to pay to finish it or wait to unlock one chapter everyday. The fast passes are one thing but the coins and daily passes are just ridiculous.","1673":"So I only gave it four stars because right now I\u2019m having issues logging in I already tried my email a lot it says please try again or try later and it just randomly logged me out also i\u2019ve been out from this app for about A few days now at first I thought it was my Internet connection but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not now \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41","1674":"I would love it if there would be a way for me to track my progress of how far into a comic i am without going in and clicking on it in the my series section. that\u2019s so far my biggest and really only complain but if you could do that i would love it and probably spend even more time on the app then i already do lol","1675":"I LOVE webtoon and have been a user for at least 3 years. I have not had a complaint ever about the app. Then came daily passes. Fast passes are ok as the user can CHOOSE to read ahead. Daily passes are just unnecessary. Sometimes I just want to reread a webtoon and I\u2019ll face the problem of daily passes. It just ruins the whole thing. AND the unlocked episodes only stay for 14 days? Please consider taking daily passes off.","1676":"I absolutely love this app, been using it for years . But since a few updates ago. I can\u2019t download stories unless my phone is on and on the app. And that\u2019s kinda annoying because if I get a phone call or text I won\u2019t be able to answer it or else it stops the download. Can u please fix that. Besides that app is great keep up the good work\n\ud83e\udd70","1677":"So I don\u2019t know what type of changes they made to their web tunes app that you used to be able to go in and buy coins with your card you didn\u2019t need to use the Apple wallet or Apple Pay and I can\u2019t seem to do that there\u2019s not even a teacher for me to go change my card information because I got a new card and it wants you to use Apple Pay well I\u2019m not gonna set up the Apple wallet no thank you. \nPlease fix or change this  pretty much ruins the app for me.","1678":"You know I absolutely love WEBTOON and this app helped me enjoy my summer time a lot but there is one thing that really confused me. Why do you make a daily pass for the comics like it makes no sense at all. You only get to read two chapters a day ! Then what\u2019s the point of reading it anymore ? People will soon get bored of it and then they will stop reading webtoon. This daily pass policy is making people don\u2019t wanna read it anymore.","1679":"I used to not like reading and it was because there were the same books and I knew what happens next until I found weeptoon I would stay up really late to read the comics I did not knew what happened next or what I expected lots or drama romance it\u2019s perfect thank you to the creator\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe","1680":"Everything was going fine but it started to tell me that the network connection wasn\u2019t working, so I went and fix the network but is still said it wasn\u2019t connected. Also the challenge that is about earning 5 coins I tried it. And I had 6 days reading but it deleted all the time I read an now am restarting everything,","1681":"I love the App, and I have been using this app for years but all the current events to get coins are great ideas but I finish all the events and I never get the coins like the current one with \u201cThe Tower of God\u201d I hit complete and then it should pop up to claim the coins and that doesn\u2019t happen and now I\u2019m just really bummed \ud83d\ude15","1682":"I had this app but my parents made me delete it because they say it bad for kids my age but every Sunday I hang out with my friend and she had webtoon so I just read from her it\u2019s amazing thank u so much for making this app when I feel sad I would read some my favorite so far I\u2019d my dear cold blood king I convinced my friend to start reading it","1683":"I\u2019ve had this app for about a week and I fell in love with it! \ud83d\ude1d you can read so many different genres such as horror,fantasy, comedy,etc. I do wish there was another way to get coins then just buying them  because I have to wait a couple days to continue reading \ud83d\ude2a But besides that it\u2019s awesome!!!","1684":"okay so this is a good app and I tried to make an account. i made the account and it told me to verify my email. i think it meant for them to send me an email and I had to confirm that I made the account. i logged on to my email account and I got no email about having to confirm that i made the WEBTOON account. I tried with 2 emails. then I tried logging in. it didn\u2019t let me. so am I just dumb or","1685":"I really like this app a lot and I am very interested with the comics in the app. But with the recent update, every time I go on WEBTOON it keeps saying that their is no internet connection even though I have good WiFi and internet. All my other apps on my phone work well so I\u2019m not sure what else to do. Please help me with the internet problem. Thank you guys very much!","1686":"This app has been awesome the pay few years! I love the uniqueness and the free range of stories it offers. But about a few weeks ago it started to claim there was \u201cno internet connection\u201d- ever. Even if I had a secure connection or full data I was using it wouldn\u2019t\/still wont load my updated comics. A bug I would love to see fixed soon so I can catch up!!","1687":"This is my favorite app I ever gotten so far. I highly recommend it. There are so many comics to choose from and so many different genres as well. Some of my favorites are True Beauty, Sirens Lament, I Love Yoo, My Deepest Secrets, Not So Silent, Lore Olympus, and LUFF to name a couple. I definitely recommend this app to people who have nothing to read and to pass time.","1688":"I really like webtoon but my main problem is that it\u2019s just not fair. People on phones can\u2019t post anything while on computers, you can post as much as you like. You would have to transfer your story to the computer or laptop and post it. My laptop keeps crashing, and the computer almost has a virus.\n\nPlease change it so people on phones can post.","1689":"This app is AMAZING. The stories are awesome to read! (I usually read the horror or thriller ones and they scare the sh** outta me) Everything is awesome, the design of the app is cool, and they organize the comics too! Love it and I\u2019ve only been using it for about a few weeks.\n\nBut heres the tiny problem:\n\nI try to sign up for Webtoon because Im in LOVE with the stories. I enter my email, Pass, bla bla bla, but when I try to proceed, It goes to my \u201cemail address\u201d and just doesn\u2019t work. So, I try my 2 other ones, but they still won\u2019t work! \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is like a glitch, my problem, or something. But yeah other than that app is AMAZING.","1690":"Progress doesn\u2019t sync across devices. When you change devices it shows all episodes you\u2019ve read on other platforms as unread and doesn\u2019t sync your progress on that device to web or other devices. It can be confusing if you read online and on iPad and iPhone.","1691":"So I downloaded this when I saw and ad about it on snap chat so I decided to get it so then it started downloading and I opened the app and I tried to sign up but whenever I pressed sign up NOW it would make me Type the email address again and I have put it in correctly and I was confused I kept pressing log in NOW but I would make me go to my email address again so I did it over and over again and got the same result I really thought this app would be very fun to have but seems like I can\u2019t so I got very disappointed and deleted it","1692":"Ok so i love webtoon and i read all of my favorite comics everyday. I dont know if its the recent update or the update on my phone but there are days where I can\u2019t even open the app it just closes right away \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d i wanna read the updated chapters but I can\u2019t because the app either freezes or crashes automatically","1693":"Hi I love using this app very much but there\u2019s just one minor improvement that I suggest to happen.\nBefore the update, one was able to move along the story line of a WEBTOON with simply just touching the bottom part of their screen.\nNow, they have to actually scroll up.\nI like just needing to tap the screen to keep on reading.\nIf this feature were to be fixed, I\u2019d love this app even more!","1694":"I really liked WEBTOON right before they put in the new policy. The new policy doesn\u2019t allow the creators to put in NSFW in to the comics and their comics get taken down completely. I do not think that this is fair to all these creators that put in lots of hard work. This new policy is making the app less enjoyable. This app is it for a little kids is for mature people that know what they\u2019re reading so it is not fair that the app treats us like we are all 6 years old. If we can get the policy fixed the ratings will go up.","1695":"Before I could read my Yaoi with NFWS warnings and stuff and everything would be fine now!! I can\u2019t at all and for the many people (artist) who made webtoons with mature content will have to not post their comics anymore it is very !! Sad that this is the new policy I am very upset and now WEBTOON is just very trashy now don\u2019t get me started about tapas you have to buy coins just to read \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d awesome comics with Yaoi in it and if you don\u2019t buy you can\u2019t read what am I supposed to do without the old webtoons","1696":"Webtoon is a great app but the new policy blocking mature content is messing everyone up. Tons of creators are having to delete episodes because of this and losing followers as a result. I get that this policy is for the minors but some of us can't afford a patron account to read the deleted episodes on. I'm writing this review because people are so aggravated that they won't even use the app anymore and that's not fair on the creators' part. This needs to be fixed.","1697":"WEBTOON is an great app for reading content made by everyday people. There is a great and supportive community in the comment section. There is a wide variety of different comics and it is 100% free and not full of adds. WEBTOON also works with Patron so you can support creators who\u2019s comics are not on the maid feed yet. If you\u2019re looking for an app to read web comics I would recommend WEBTOON to anyone!","1698":"Okay so this is a really fun app for a fujoshi like me. And I\u2019ve found so many comments i like. But my one problem is that we can only subscribe to only 100 webcomics and i\u2019ve subscribed to 100 and i have so many more comics i wanna subscribe to as well. So i\u2019ve had to resorted to unsubscribing to a lot of comics which pains me. I wish we would have the chance to subscribe to more.","1699":"I loved WEBTOON! But today I logged on and I was signed out. I logged back in but everything I earned wat lost. All the series I was subscribed to was gone all my history was gone, EVERYTHING! The hard earned coins I got were gone! I had been subscribed to so many series! WEBTOON please give me my history back and my hard-earned coins back. I had nine before and now only five from the current event. In total it was 14. Please give me my stuff back","1700":"I love the app! But I want to make my own Webtoon and have a plot layer out and the first chapter done but it\u2019s on my iPad and it doesn\u2019t allow me to post on mobile devices. I have a laptop but it makes it a lot harder to actually transfer the comic to my laptop so I can post it. It would be a big help if Webtoon could be updated to allow its users to post comics on mobile devices.","1701":"Having this app for a few years now and I can proudly say that it is ONE of the only webcomic I can confidently recommend. It has a wide arrange of comics for your taste. And their mascots (Skeddy, Wyatt, and Wiggle) helps new authors to be quickly recognized and becoming a original. I love their work and that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving 5 stars. Will strongly recommend this app!","1702":"Like I love the app and I love to able to read those amazing stories. BUT this is the second time I loose a reward for an app problem. The first time were like 30 coins (I don\u2019t remember well the exact number) for being with webtoon for a long time and the second time the omniscient story check in. I had the app updated it and it went to a white screen and didn\u2019t let me claim anything.\n\nOther than that good app \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","1703":"just why? why do this? I love webtoon, I don\u2019t mind waiting 7 days because the artists and writers need time to make it good quality. People rating this get mad or upset about it, which is odd because they need the time to create these. People have their own lives, it\u2019s like watching a tv show that releases one episode a week. Anyways for daily passes I just have found out today, and I wanted to try new series and it said daily pass on multiple episodes of a series.. we should be able to binge the episodes.. please take this off","1704":"Upon logging in today on the app, my previously owned coins we\u2019re missing. I logged onto my Apple account where I\u2019ve been charging them and to no avail. All the coins I\u2019ve purchased are all gone, this is literal theft. I\u2019ve been a long member and this is really disappointing... I\u2019ve sent a ticket to Apple and hopefully I get this cleared up or I\u2019m moving my money to other sites or I\u2019ll just find them free online, I tried to support the content creators by buying coins for unlocks but this is... isn\u2019t right, stealing coins.","1705":"There\u2019s this summer event where readers have a choice between two Webtoons to read 24 episodes of for 5 free coins; but BOTH of the series are daily pass? On a time limit of 5 days? Therefore making it impossible to read 24 episodes. That\u2019s kind of stupid, but okay. Some other completed series are also on daily pass. I was upset finding out Bastard had it, too. Webtoon is great in every other way, though.","1706":"I\u2019ve been using Webtoon since 2017 and it was the perfect app until Daily Pass came along. I was going to binge read some old webcomics and then I see something called Daily Pass. I was confused and found out I could only read 1 or 2 episode(s) a day. I find it ridiculous that I could only read 1-2 episode(s) a day. It\u2019s also ridiculous how 1 Daily Pass episode only lasts for 14 days. I would\u2019ve rated this app 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for Daily Pass. Please take Daily Pass down.","1707":"I feel like I\u2019ve just been punked. The update puts a timer on past completed comics. I was just reading Noblesse and now... I can only read 2 chapters per day???? You\u2019re going to see people flocking to pirate sites and directing business away from your site, which hurts your authors and your bottom line. I can\u2019t believe I traded the ability to read whole comics for free for 10 lousy coins. I am much less likely to spend money on this platform now. Congratulations, webtoon. You\u2019re just as bad as other paid comic platforms.","1708":"So I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for a while now, and have really enjoyed it. My favorites are Lunime, Mage and Demon Queen, HAFU, and Boyfriends. However, recently, the app won\u2019t open. I\u2019ve refreshed it, restarted my phone, and even deleted the app and re-downloaded it, but nothing works. Has anyone else had this problem, and how do I fix it? I\u2019ve loved WEBTOON for so long and I don\u2019t want to stop reading my favorites. Please help!!!","1709":"I love this app a lot. I also LOVE the stories. But I have an issue that probably EVERYBODY hates. There is a limit thing to where when u get to a certain point. U have to log in and make an account OR wait 3 days to read the next part. I DONT WANT TO FRICKEN LOG IN TO READ SOMETHING. And, I DONT WANT TO WAIT 3 DAYS! Please GET. RID. OF. THIS. Oh and also, so I tried to sign in and then log in and that stuff. BUT IT KEEPS SAYING THAT MY EMAIL IS INVALID OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT","1710":"So I love this app and I want to make story\u2019s on it. I can make them on my iPad easier then on the computer and I would love to be able to just publish on mobile so I don\u2019t have to figure out how to transfer the pics to my computer. This would also make publishing easier for other people that publish story\u2019s on this app","1711":"I really like this app. I\u2019ve had it for a while. But lately it hasn\u2019t been working. It won\u2019t load properly. When I click on a comic, it doesn\u2019t load, and I have to close the app a couple times to get it to work, and even then, it\u2019ll freeze and I\u2019ll have to close it again. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s just my phone or my internet connection, but i haven\u2019t been able to read anything for a couple days","1712":"Dear webtoon, I love reading the different stories everyday but recently the new policy has changed things. Lots of the stories I read have had to been discontinued or given a new plot because of it; I feel bad for the authors because now they have to make new ideas instead of continuing what they wanted and I think the warning at the beginning of the episode is enough.","1713":"First off, you only have to pay for future episodes, not current episodes which is one of the best features of this app. Second of all, sometimes, WEBTOON allows creators to update early and they update a day before the release. On top of the massive amounts of original comics to read. This app truly is one of the best","1714":"I\u2019m so sad about this. I love the stories on this app but it just won\u2019t stop crashing!!! It either completely crashes or it freezes up, and it\u2019s driving me crazy! I\u2019ve done all the things that are suggested to do, and after deleting the app and re-downloading it multiple times, I\u2019m done. Stories are great. The app itself has way too many problems. I hope the developers can fix it. I won\u2019t know if they do though, because I\u2019m done! I\u2019ll find some other way to read these stories.","1715":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOON for a long time there are many amazing authors and great story\u2019s and I enjoy reading them but I hate the new policy. Many authors have had to reduce their story or had to stop completely cause it doesn\u2019t work with WEBTOON a new policy. And now we have to go on patreon and pay to see what was once free to the readers cause some of us don\u2019t have the extra money to waste on online things. They need to change it back.","1716":"I previously made an account and haven\u2019t used the app in a while. I deleted the app, and now, I\u2019m trying to log in again, and it tells me my email isn\u2019t in their database or whatever. So I say \u201cokay, I\u2019ll just sign up then\u201d and then I put in my information and it tells me I can\u2019t sign up because that email already has an account. PLEASE FIX THAT. now there\u2019s no way for me to sign up because it says it\u2019s not there so I can\u2019t log in but I also can\u2019t sign in because it says that the email already exists.","1717":"So I have one problem. You get watch comics free for a long time but then you have to pay money to watch. And if you don\u2019t have the money then you either need to wait HOURS or DAYS to watch comics! Other than that its AMAZING!! Great quality comics, awesome design, and so much more. It\u2019s amazing and my only problems are the waiters issues. Thank you!","1718":"It\u2019s amazing people don\u2019t even have to pay or even sign up to read amazing comics from professional and part time creators. I love the idea of FastPass to support the deserving authors and help with wait times for updates. However, the app freezes, forcing you to restart and power off your device, only for it to inevitably freeze again. Because of this, I have to give this 5 star app a 3 :( Please fix the bug soon!","1719":"Sometimes when I try to add a comment it will tell me there is no internet despite my internet working fine everywhere else, and the fact that I can access the webtoon itself. It\u2019s a bug I thought was only on my old phone but it\u2019s happening with the new phone as well. Please fix! I love webtoons and really want to be able to share and like comments. I currently have ios12 and and iPhone 8.","1720":"I love this app! But I only have one complaint.. \nWhy can\u2019t this app remember where I am on different devices? I read one webtoon series on my phone and then I decide to pick up where I left off on my tablet. But guess what? The tablet has no idea where I was in a story or any story for that matter. I have to look at my phone to remember where I was even at. \n\nI find this annoying and tedious.","1721":"This is such an amazing platform and I look forward to reading my subscriptions almost everyday, but when I download a comic it seems almost pointless because usually they have a difficult time loading anyways. Also, I wish there was an option to go and look at the comics you\u2019ve so called \u201cfavorited\u201d by pressing the little heart.","1722":"Ok I would just like to start out by saying that when I first got the app it was amazing and had everything you were looking for, but now because of the new policy on there it limits the creators on there\u2019s creativity, before the new policy they were able express their thoughts and feelings for all the readers to enjoy. But now because of it, readers aren\u2019t able to enjoy what they came for and the creators aren\u2019t able to express themselves in every way they can with their art.","1723":"I loved it the way it was and you chose two change it most people enjoyed its yaoi and now the ones I liked the most are gone what\u2019s next you gonna censor the words u don\u2019t like that\u2019s just stupid change it back I miss the giving full freedom to the artist who drew that and even tho the full image isn\u2019t there I still enjoyed it and now it\u2019s just full on banned and now one of my favorite ones(bad dog bl) has discontinued their whole series all because u wanted to please some idiots","1724":"With Webtoons it is all free and you only have to wait for the author to update the comic. There is a wide variety of comics in multiple genres. I have personally got hooked on more then one comic and they all update every week! I would recommend My dear cold blooded king, I love yoo, and Age matters. All artist have a different art style which also supplies in variety.","1725":"I\u2019ve just gotten the app and I entered all of my information but when I clicked sign up nothing happened. There was no email no nothing. When I tried to register again it said that my email was already registered. I really want to figure out why I\u2019ve been having this problem","1726":"first off, I would like to say that I love LOVE this app. Its amazing and the comics provided on here are great. (Check out <Lookism>) However, my webtoons are supposed to show up at 6pm everyday. They are now starting to show up around 7 or 8 pm. Maybe the LINE people can add a refresh button to let me see what comic have been updated already.","1727":"WEBTOON\u2019s has become a regular service for me and I didn\u2019t mind them putting ads at the end of chapters even if it annoyed me a bit. But the new video HBO NOW ad playing IN THE MIDDLE of a chapter is disruptive, unnecessary, and making the app crash. I don\u2019t think ads are necessary in the first place but if they\u2019re going to be there, don\u2019t make them invasive and mess up your own app. Fix this bug NOW.","1728":"I participated in a reading event where we were promised coins if we read all the episodes of said series listed, and I did before the deadline, only to not receive any coins at all. I checked comments and saw a lot of people upset that the same happened to them. Once the glitch is fixed and I receive my coins I\u2019ll gladly give 5 stars","1729":"I woke up this morning and decided to download this app to read because I was bored. Shortly after downloading the app, I heard a knock on the door. I went to go answer it and it was a raid of children saying that they were arresting me! I asked who sent them and they said they were sent from you. I was then taken to their lab where they experimented on me and made me write stories about spongebob and barbie! It was horrible. I was there for 20 days until Shrek came and saved me! It took me a couple of days to recover from this. It was very traumatizing.","1730":"This app is great for reading but I don\u2019t really like the way that I need to buy coins for some stories cause I\u2019m not here to spend real money and the stories that need coins are my favorite stories I think that those are very interesting that why it need coins but I want to read them SOO badly and yet they need coins but overall this is an amazing app for anyone that love reading.","1731":"I love webtoon but I don\u2019t want to wait to read more episodes. Because not everyone has enough money to buy coin but they want to read the story as soon as possible so I think the coins are a not essential add in to the app. But other than that I\u2019m giving it a 5 star rating.","1732":"I have had WEBTOON for 4-5 years with the same account. I had no problems with app until now. I tried to redeem my free coins that I earned, but it will not allow me. It tells me that I have \u201cregistered\u201d to only one device. I only use WEBTOON on my iPhone. I have only purchased coins from my iPhone. This has never happened before until recently. And I haven\u2019t login into other devices in years.","1733":"I absolutely love we toon it is one of my favorite apps, it\u2019s what got me to love reading comics and manga. One problem that I have with it though is that I have both my iPad and phone logged in and when there\u2019s a daily pass it would only let me get it on one device so if I want to read a daily pass in my iPad I have to go to my phone and get the daily pass there first.","1734":"it\u2019s amazing! my favorite comics are \u201ctrue beauty,Subzero,and \u201cMy dear cold blooded king\u201d\nbut i hate the fact that we have to wait every single week:\/ like the episodes are already ready why not just let us read them?! it\u2019s so frustrating cause we have nothing to do during quarantine so i suggest just let us read all the episodes without waiting :\/ - stitchzoee on tiktok","1735":"I would definitely recommend this to any one who likes reading chapter books but seeing the pictures ( I have yet to see a webtoon where the drawings weren\u2019t fire ) and I personally recommend a book I\u2019ve been reading it\u2019s called \u201c Subzero \u201c it is AMAZING I would describe it as a action, romance and a drama lots of twists and turns","1736":"I love this app but some of the stories have gone like downhill a little bit. but that\u2019s ok because i\u2019ll still read them but if you want some stories to read  i\u2019d your just downloading the app i would definitely recommend cursed princess club and off girl out. this are definitely my favorites.","1737":"If the creator is reading this please fix it. so I was doing the new event and for some reason the app glitches and I had to refresh it and when I went into the app it said I read almost all the books but it took away some of my roses so can you please fix the problem","1738":"Ever since the fast pass thing was added I\u2019ve had to relogin to my account every time I opened the account but it auto logged me in as soon as a read a bit of a chapter. Unfortunately as of yesterday it\u2019s no longer relogging me in. I tried resetting my passcode but it said email address not found. App is unusable now as I lost all my coins and am frozen out even after entering the correct passcode.","1739":"It used to be fun it used be different it used to be an app where you could read whatever type of manga you wanted to whatever age you were there was always something for you but now.... it\u2019s different I guess you guys decided that money was more important than the freedom of reading now people how to wait a day to read what they want to read or even reread becuz it\u2019s their favorite manga. WEBTOON is now on the verge of changing into every other manga app there is.","1740":"I love reading stories like Lore Olympus and Cursed Princesses Club! But here\u2019s the thing. \n\n1. FAST PASSES, it\u2019s so unfair that you have to spend money on virtual coins to read a series you love! And if you don\u2019t you have to wait 1 week or more! I understand that you have to get your moneys worth but unacceptable. You won\u2019t catch me being a donk and spending money on that. I\u2019m sorry but you won\u2019t.\n\n2. The comments. I hate reading those. People who write those are so annoying.  So I think it would be best if we disable them. For the sake of people like me temper\u2019s. \n\n3. I Absolutely LOVE WEBTOON. But those are my problems with it. Overall it\u2019s an amazing app, and I recommend downloading it! Stay safe and much love! \ud83d\udc95","1741":"I like the stories, I don\u2019t like the wait. I bought coins but when i used them i had to wait longer before the next chapter was unlocked. I can\u2019t afford to buy coins all the time so I\u2019ve gotten to where i only read on this app once maybe twice a month. But the stories i have read a great. I was sad to see some end.","1742":"Webtoon is a very good platform but I\u2019m having trouble getting that push notifications spin wheel thing I\u2019ve been on the app at 4pm and 11pm I\u2019ve also turned on post notifications and have updated the app yet I haven\u2019t got any coins my cousin has the same problem but my sister doesn\u2019t so is this app glitching ? Because I\u2019ve been waiting to get coins","1743":"Webtoon is definitely a great way to share stories! It helps me laugh and cry, and I love all the creators! The only thing I would want to fix is that with the recent development that involves ads, sometimes the ads won\u2019t work! Some of my favorite comics are limited by ads and I can\u2019t read them until the next update comes out. I love Webtoon, but please fix this!!!","1744":"i absolutely hate daily pass with a passion. The app itself is amazing. i\u2019ve been reading webtoon for about 4-5 years i think ? I have unconditional love for this app but the daily pass is annoying and unneeded. I enjoyed binge reading Girls of the Wild and Bastard. I can\u2019t anymore though because i have to do Daily Pass now which takes too long. Please fix this.","1745":"I downloaded this cuz I was bored and I kept seeing ads for so I installed it and I love down to earth but I can\u2019t buy coins because don\u2019t have money so I wish there was like a daily reward every day for 5 coins that way more people would download it because they don\u2019t have to pay for coins as much","1746":"I have had Webtoon since 2017. I really liked it. However, most authors of good and popular series no longer post and say they are on \"an indefinite hiatus.\" Before, I could read 3-4 episodes of different series every day. Now I'm lucky enough to have one episode. I feel bad for complaining, but I feel like Webtoon has gone downhill and does not provide quality content anymore. In addition, you have to watch ada to read some episodes. That sounds a little over the top now! Really gone down since 2017.","1747":"I\u2019ve had this app forever and love the comics but yesterday two of my favorite comics updated and after opening the app and clicking on the page of one of them it just froze. The chapters didn\u2019t load, and I could not press any buttons. I tried deleting and redownloading the app but it continued to do the same thing, not even allowing me to sign in. Please fix this!! I just want to read my comics!","1748":"I\u2019ve been using Webtoons for almost a year and I\u2019ve loved it so far! But there\u2019s a new problem: I was reading the comic True Beauty and an ad popped up for the first time ever while I was in the middle of reading. It was a cartoon porn ad. Like it showed them having s3x and everything. I\u2019m 17 and while it may be okay for me to see stuff like that, what if one of the younger users saw it?? Things like that just aren\u2019t okay. Please fix this.","1749":"Why is it when I purchased the coins not logged in they disappeared when I logged in. And when I logged out to see if they would come back since I purchased them not logged in, they were still not there?? This is the second time this has happened. I contacted support the first time, but they were no help since it was just an automated reply asking for more info. But I already gave them more than enough. I have contacted them again, hopefully they do their job and give me my money back.","1750":"I am a fan of fast pass. I buy fast pass for series I enjoy and I fully support it because it is OPTIONAL and the episodes are still available FOR FREE if someone doesn\u2019t want to use fast pass.\n\nDAILY PASS, however, I do not support. all it does is take away all the joy in bingeing a completed series and this provides incentive for us to go to pirated sites that don\u2019t support the authors at all.\n\nyou\u2019re making things worse off.","1751":"I honestly love the WEBTOON app! I sure do like reading all of the webtoons but there\u2019s just this one thing, I\u2019ve made a comic and have tried to post it on here but there\u2019s not publish button on the iPad, I\u2019ve looked on google\/safari for answers but they all say to use a computer. I\u2019m thinking about posting it on a different website but I just don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all.","1752":"So simply put great service with TONS of great story\u2019s(tho if your picky there\u2019s not enough) but one bug has made me uninstall the app a few times because it messed with my sub-box and would basically not show me what\u2019s new and once I clicked on it then it would basically disappear from my sub box till I reinstall the app","1753":"this app is absolutely amazing! I basically love it a lot you can read almost all the comics for free without paying for chapters like tappy toons where you have to buy tokens and then pay there for ever chapter in this you get your chapter then you just wait for he next one to come out and it\u2019s totally free! Great app keep up the good work","1754":"Ok, I love this app and I use it daily because the comics are soooooo good but the new rule that has been placed on WEBTOON is not it. Me, as a WEBTOON reader is angry that we can\u2019t read the \u201cmature\u201d content that the very talented authors post because some children don\u2019t understand what 18+ means. I\u2019m Sure the authors are not fond of it either. I hope for the rule to be removed soon. P.S- DOWNLOAD its REALLY GREAT\/ addicting;)","1755":"I\u2019ve had this app for a little over a two weeks and somewhere in those two weeks I haven\u2019t seen a single thing relating to how one should be capable of getting free coins. In future updates, I would like there to be some information on how to get free coins. Overall, I really enjoy what\u2019s on this app.","1756":"Everything about this app is perfect other than the fact that I can\u2019t download a series fully and it\u2019s annoying when you have to go through every episode and download it, I\u2019d be on this app everywhere I go if I could just get a way to download them.","1757":"Along with many, the new policy limits my choices of who I can subscribe to and keeps me from being updated with the comics I follow. In addition, yesterday\u2019s update keeps my comics from being show in my list and causes the app to crash saying I have no internet connection when I do on other sites and apps. Please remove the policy and please fix the bugs! I love this app for comics and I want to keep reading them!","1758":"Some key points that really impress me and help the quality of life:\n- keeps track of progress in terms of chapters you\u2019ve read, both on the app and on a computer\n- can download on WiFi and read offline for later\n- no ads (or at least I haven\u2019t seen any)\n- great selection of web comics","1759":"I love WEBTOON but my app has been acting weird I never get notifications on time and it loads long it constantly kicks me off the app when I\u2019m reading and my comics have been coming early my comics that were all supposed to come Friday came Thursday a day early and didn\u2019t update the next day if all this is fixed I\u2019d give it a five star since the authors and creators work so hard and I enjoy reading their work.","1760":"I was reading down to earth episode 51 and when I had finished it and went to go click on episode 52 it told me I had to put in my email address and it really hurt me because I don\u2019t really have a an email address and idk how long ima have to wait to read episode 52 but other than that it\u2019s a really good app definitely recommend it!","1761":"Ok first of all I think Webtoons is a great app and that it doesn\u2019t require coins and stuff to read the comics. But recently they changed their policies and I ask if they could change it back?? To when they used to allow 18+ content. I know some people might now like how it is on an app where maybe kids would be on but could you consider adding a separate section for us who like reading it?? With plenty of warnings. -A","1762":"So many creators had to stop their work because of the new policy change and according to the new policy they can't leave links for the people that want to support the comics and creators. I have nothing left to read on here anymore because all my favorite creators have left due to this policy. Instead of banning nudity and sexual content you should make a separate category for it otherwise you'll lose all your creators and readers because it's not worth having this app if there's no content.","1763":"K so the stories are great I don\u2019t really have problems but with the downloading chapters it is I waited like 30-40 minutes waiting for true beauty to finish downloading. I didn\u2019t really mind the wait tho, and when I was offline I was gonna read it but the app just wouldn\u2019t let go in like it was stuck. So I wasted like 30 minutes for nothing.","1764":"I looooove WEBTOOn. But I have a problem w the daily passes. Like I just want to reread a story I liked but I can\u2019t really do that. I was fine w the 3 daily passes but now they\u2019ve reduced it to 1?? It gets annoying bc it\u2019s only unlocked for a limited amount of time and if I\u2019d ever want to reread it again I would probably have to try and unlock it AGAIN. It just feels very weird to me :(","1765":"I absolutely LOVE Webtoon, love it, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been kicking me out for some reason, I really wanna catch up to some series\u2019 and I\u2019ve un-installed and re-installed it about 40-50 times now. I\u2019m getting kinda frustrated, but I\u2019m trying to remain calm. I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s either my device, or the app. I don\u2019t wanna come of as rude, it\u2019s just I\u2019m having a little problem.","1766":"I completed an update and when I logged back in to the app everything was gone all my coins and my subscribed toons. So sad right now.....\n\nTotally my fault, it must have logged me out and instead of logging back in through FB I used my email.... all my stuff is right where I left it super excitedly","1767":"EDIT: It started working normally the next day. I\u2019m glad :-)\n\nThis app was working really well until a couple of minutes ago. All of the sudden it crashed and every time I would tap on the icon to open it, it would crash again. I tried quitting it and reopening it. But it just doesn\u2019t start anymore. It immediately crashes every single time I tap on the app to open it.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how this happened so suddenly because this app has been reliable and worked very smoothly until now.\n\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?","1768":"So I have the webtoon app and it\u2019s been working great, but for some reason I can\u2019t get into the app at all. Even after turning my phone off twice and deleting and redownloading the app (which may have taken away all my data) I\u2019m still not able to get in a it glitches me out. I hope this gets fixed cause it\u2019s only happened maybe twice before, and then it went back to normal.","1769":"Webtoons has been great, I haven\u2019t had any problems as a reader. But since its pride month and they now have an easier way to find LGBTQIA+ specific content, it would be nice if they kept that as an option. I typically have a very hard time finding anything other than straight romance unless I do a very deep search.","1770":"Please fix the reward ads, it\u2019s so annoying to wait for the episodes where we can unlock them with an ad, and then the ads don\u2019t show up, so we can\u2019t advance to the next episode. It is absolutely one of the most annoying things that should have been fixed by now. These have been tested on for months now, and they still don\u2019t work right at all.","1771":"I normally would\u2019ve loved WEBTOON and given it a five star rating. I am also an avid user of the fast pass. However this \u201cdaily pass\u201d is trash, and does naught but push new possible users of the app away. So, I must do this to let the developers know that they have taken a step too far. Nobody should have to pay for 4\/5ths of an episode just to see something that was released eight years ago and has been open to the public ever since. And now it\u2019s being taxed. Was ads and fast pass not enough for you?","1772":"Please help, I haven\u2019t been on webtoon in awhile and when I try to enter webtoon after awhile it logged me out. I tried to log back in with my email and password but it says it cannot load information and to try again later. This has been going on for a few days. I tried to restart my password by sending my email just in case it was a password issue but it also said it can\u2019t load information. I hope to solve this issue as soon as possible.","1773":"Not really a fan of the app. I started reading one story and they are like comic book pages. You can read a few for free to start then to finish the story you have to buy coins. If you don\u2019t buy the coins you have to wait 6-13 days to get the next page. The one story i started reading was good but i will delete the app. It\u2019s a waste of time and the comics don\u2019t have you hooked enough to have to pay for it. And I\u2019m not waiting 13 days for the next page.","1774":"Ok first I wanna say the the app is great so far it\u2019s just that when I listen to make music it gets stopped by the ads that play a video and it gets annoying so I just asking if it is possible to remove ads that a video so it would stop stopping my music??","1775":"I would rate this five stars if there was a way to remove stuff from \u201cmy webtoon\u201d because I either stop reading one or accidentally click on one and to me it\u2019s annoying to see one I don\u2019t read. So can you please add a feature where you can delete stuff from \u201cmy webtoon\u201d and if it\u2019s already in can you tell me how to do it.","1776":"So webtoon is a wonderful app and I\u2019ve had it for a while now. I use it all the time, but I\u2019ve noticed that the app freezes a lot while reading and you need to force quit and reopen the comic. Most times, it just freezes again and it\u2019s very frustrating. I\u2019d love it if this glitch was fixed.","1777":"I absolutely love the app but recently they updated the feature upload schedule to like around 9:00 pm instead of 12:00 am, which is a good thing, but on the schedule board they have on the app it\u2019s still says the WEBTOONs are gonna be updated the next day. It\u2019s a pretty stupid request but idk.","1778":"The no NSFW policy is kind of a bummer and sometimes when you search up the title of a webtoon it won\u2019t show up, however to fix that you can search the title on any kind of browser and read it on the website. The quality is really great and the stories are captivating, this app helps pass time and provides entertainment.","1779":"I\u2019ve been using this comic sight for a long time and I loved how it was a platform that you don\u2019t have to pay anything for. Until they brought \u201cCOINS\u201d into the playing field. They brought micro transactions in. You pay real money to get coins. The coins can buy episodes that have not come out to the public yet. It really felt bad seeing my favorite app sell out and start demanding money from you","1780":"I know you can make and upload comics on the computer but will it ever come to mobile? I know, people will more than likely install paint tool sai or photoshop on their computer but what about just people who have phones? Buzzing with ideas but no way to publish them? I would enjoy to see the ability to make comics on mobile in the future.","1781":"I would like to give it a full star rating. But they don't carry a lot of the webcomics they used to. Like tales of demons and gods. Or the star-martial artist. But they still have a few really good ones like tower of God and the gamer. It's a fun pass time read. And doesn't take up much room on my crappy 5th gen phone. So I can read comics on my leisure. Keep more interesting titles coming.","1782":"I've had this app since 2016 and have found a lot of great stories here. There are other things you can do besides reading, like translating a comic (not all comics; the author needs to allow it first but you can send a request to webtoons) to a different language or correcting grammar. You can submit fan art to the author, if they provide an email. It's a really fun app. I recommend it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","1783":"While signing up, I entered my email and the rest of the info required to create an account. How ever, once touching the sign up button, my email was denied because it had apparently \u201calready been used\u201d despite the fact that I had never tried to sign up for the app. However, I think the idea of free comic reads would be great. (My problem with signing up could just be me forgetting, but I have no memory in the slightest of attempting to create an account.)","1784":"I love this app...it has sooooo many variations and so many stories for you to read! I love the app personally because I can have a favorite and have another one...I love series that can last forever and never end...The authors for the stories and comics are very talented and also open minded,creative,and very artistic about their stories...","1785":"Only reason is because I have to wait so long to read an episode. I would prefer to peacefully read the episode with having to wait a week or more just for 1 episode? These episodes are really short. If your gonna make me wait, at least give me 2-4 free episodes before making me wait a couple more days","1786":"Honestly I stumbled upon webtoon like finding and illusory wall in dark souls. It just kind of happened! I honestly think it\u2019s one of the best apps like this! All the others have ads or you have to pay to keep reading or just aren\u2019t optimized as well as webtoon. I have no complains about this app whatsoever! Keep up the amazing work!!","1787":"I absolutely admire WEBTOON!! But there\u2019s one problem. I always try my best to collect as much coins as possible so I can enjoy more episodes so I like to save them up. One thing I didn\u2019t know was that the coins expire \ud83d\ude20 I had about 41 coins collected and when I tried to use them, it said I didn\u2019t have any. I\u2019m very upset about this. Why advertise to win coins if they expire! This is very upsetting. I enjoy WEBTOON very much, this is just a set back.","1788":"Daily pass stuff is ridiculous and makes it hard to read a whole story through, new uses eventually you get tired of only being able to read a little bit at a time and makes the story feel blocky. Also DO NOT let your 12 yr. old read these! This should definitely be like 18 and over ....","1789":"I\u2019ve been using webtoon for over a year now, and I wanted to say it\u2019s such a great app! Unlike most comic apps on your phone, you DONT have to pay if you don\u2019t want to, but you can still help the creator! I love the range of the webtoons, but I do wish they would feature a bit more action comics. Overall, I\u2019m in love!","1790":"This app used to be fine, but now every time I get to the bottom of a comic the app crashes or opens an add in safari or opens the app store. I\u2019m not even clicking the ads. They\u2019re automatically opening. We aren\u2019t even allowed to go back and read finished webtoons anymore without spending money or waiting forever. I\u2019m about to go back to using sources that don\u2019t support the authors. I want to support authors, but Webtoon is making it hard with these pop up ads that kick me out of the app. It\u2019s infuriating. Stop selling out.","1791":"2021. I've been with webtoon for years now and as more webcomic apps came I would try them but they cost money so I would always go back to webtoon. Webtoon I thought you wouldn't care about the money and just let us read the comics for free but I come back to the app to see that you making people pay and honestly i was definitely hurt because I came back to support my favorite comics and reread them but now I'd have to wait and pay for them. That's crazy and heartbreaking to know you people went so low.","1792":"Ok, there\u2019s something wrong with the app. So I downloaded webtoon a couple years ago, and the app was working fine and showed up on the App Store as open. But, for some reason now there\u2019s another app that\u2019s pretty much the same, which is this. Both of the versions work fine. So now I have 2 of the same app. Do you know why this happened? By the way, I can\u2019t find the other one here anymore.","1793":"This app is ok over all. It\u2019s amazing but It has a bug where sometimes it won\u2019t open. It\u2019s not my phone because it has space for more data and it\u2019s a new apple model. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening but it just takes me out when I try to open it. I tried to re download it but that didn\u2019t work. Please help.","1794":"Idk what\u2019s going on with my app; it was working just fine an hour ago and now I can\u2019t even open it. I\u2019ve tried deleting then redownloading it, turning my phone off for a while then back on.... what\u2019s up with that? Anyone else? I have this app a long time and never had issues with it, not to mention this is the best app in my phone. Help??","1795":"I really like the app, I have an account and if I get it on another device my progress is gone. It\u2019s really annoying and frustrating, I would give it 5 stars when my progress stays, even when I download the app again. I have to re-read the story or go past all the episodes until the one that I\u2019m on, please fix this.","1796":"Don\u2019t get me wrong! This app is amazing and fun but the only issue for me is.. for me to be able to sign in, I can\u2019t even make an account on the app and I used all my thing my google, my actual email, fake email, and yet NONE seem to be able to let me sign in, idk if it\u2019s my own issue or the app, if that issue was fixed I will give you five stars :)","1797":"I\u2019ve had webtoon for over 4 years and loved every moment of it. It\u2019s one of the most reliable apps and forms of entertainment, bringing a closeness to the artist and the reader. I love watching creators start from the bottom and be given a chance too tell and have their stories published as originals. I will forever be a fan of webtoon, and i stand by that.","1798":"How do I get in it takes me to the select a genre and I try to select the story called the four of them by putting romance and drama. Then the button on the bottom of the screen that says next lights up and then it takes me to the next step that says choose a new style when I just did. PLEASE HELP?","1799":"I really like the stories here. I have one that I read every day of the week. My main issue is that the comments are not well monitored. People say inappropriate things and for comics that were first released in another language spoilers. There is nothing worse than reading a story every week only to see the storyline spoiled in the top comments. Even after tons of downvotes and people reporting these comments they remain up to spoil everyone\u2019s experience.","1800":"So far, the app has been amazing. One issue is that when I open a Webtoon WITH music, the song won\u2019t play. I\u2019ve tried turning the music on and off, I even made sure nothing was playing or able to play (I don\u2019t have the music app on my iPad). I tried closing the app and going back in, but it still won\u2019t work. Please fix it!!! Thank you","1801":"I have connection and WiFi. I don\u2019t understand why is says I\u2019m not connected. I\u2019ve tried updating the app but their aren\u2019t any updates available. I\u2019ve also tried uninstalling the app, restarting my phone, and closing out of the app. Nothings working. Please fix this problem so I can read my comics. I love this app and don\u2019t wanna have to abandon it. Thanks :)","1802":"I love this reading\/story app because it doesn\u2019t cost 20 or a monthly subscription to read stories (from what I know so far) I can read a bunch of stories and no ads in between. It\u2019s so chill and full of stories lots can enjoy and I love it. No I wasn\u2019t paid to say this I generally like it. More power to you Webtoons\u270a\ud83c\udfff","1803":"I\u2019ve had no problems with this app and I\u2019ve had it for 1 year. The story\u2019s are so interesting and whenever I am bored I go to this app! I don\u2019t really use this app for road trips because I get very car sick, but if I could use it for road trips I would definitely go right to the app! Amazing job on the app. Very cool!!","1804":"I\u2019ve subscribed to so many webtoons and I spend hours reading them sometimes. However, when I\u2019m out of the house, loading can be a little slow. I\u2019ll have to constantly reload the panel in hopes it will finally show up. There are times where I just give up. Is there any way to make this load even just a bit faster?","1805":"I\u2019d been using it Weekly to keep up with some comics I like, but since a few days ago, I think when the latest update was pushed through, I was logged out of my account and cannot log back in. I also keep getting a pop up that says \u201cserver errors.\u201d Really disappointing because I want to use fast pass on my favorite comic but I cannot do so without being logged in since the coins I bought are linked to my iOS account. Please fix it","1806":"This app is really interesting and fun. I love all the stories that they have and they have lots of different genres. I would recommend Lookism, Unordinary, True Beauty, Save me(for BTS ARMY), and Lumine. Some of them are fantasy and some are real life and relatable things that we can all connect to. They make me look forward to tomorrow and get me excited.","1807":"I have always loved webtoon and I\u2019ve had it for a LONG time now. Within the past few months I have been kicked out of my account and unable to login with any of my Facebook(which is how I have always logged in), my email, or by creating a new account. This needs fixed because i am not able to subscribe to any of my comics anymore, or even keep my reading progress. Please fix","1808":"i love webtoon but the new update came out and now there is a thing called fast pass in the fast pass you have to pay for it\u2026 And before that there wasn\u2019t a thing. I switched to WEBTOON because of the other apps had coins that you had to pay for and now webtoon does it and you have to wait out for 6 days just to get the other episodes if you didn\u2019t pay for a fast pass.","1809":"This app is great and I love it. Fun way to pass the time. Interesting stories. And an easy way to say up all the things that you want to read. Think only thing that I would add if anything is an autoscrolling feature for when you don\u2019t have your hands free to touch your phone. Overall though this is an AWESOME app.","1810":"I love webtoon since I got it, never had a problem besides only being united to 100 webtoons. And if it was discover I was fine with, but now it seems like it includes featured as well. I\u2019m just wondering if this will ever change. Mostly the featured but would like it to not exist on discover as well.","1811":"Webtoon is an awesome platform for comics and authors and I thoroughly enjoy using this app. However, the placements of ads after each comic is poorly placed. After nearly every chapter I read, I accidentally click on an ad while scrolling. This really impairs the enjoyment of using this app and I think developers can spend some time to fix this easily. I know ads are necessary but please fix their placement on the app. If this is fixed I will definitely change my rating to 5 stars.","1812":"Webtoon has been working great for me until now.  For some reason the app crashes immediately after I open it. I don\u2019t know why this is happening but I have been unable to read the AMAZING STUFFS on Webtoon because of this and it is driving me nuts. I hope this can be fixed? But other than that it was working amazingly for me and the stories are WONDERFUL.\n\nThe crashing is getting worse I can\u2019t get through 1 chapter I NEED TO READ THISSSS. I\u2019m probably going to have withdrawals from webtoons XD but I am unhappy with this issue. Hopefully it can be fixed?","1813":"I really like this app but the new policy has to go. Restrictions have to be made but to a certain extent and they went to far. If there is some content for above 18 than leave if if younger people are reading than that\u2019s on them don\u2019t punish the other readers or authors because because every generation seems to be getting older at younger ages. I\u2019m pretty sure many kids under 18 have seen worse at this point.","1814":"I really love WEBTOON because it gives up and coming artists a chance to get their work out there. WEBTOON should be a place of creative freedom, not restrictions. I do not approve of the new policy change because some of my favorite webtoons have had to change the plot of their stories entirely to just make it fit the policy. How about instead of changing the policy, let artists have their freedom and make it harder for underage readers to view mature content if thats what you\u2019re really worried about.","1815":"This was an amazing app until the change of the policy.I used to come in here everyday and now most of my favorite story are discontinued because of this policy.I hope you will see this and many other people\u2019s complaints and change it back cause you might lose a lot of us cause of our favorite comics shutting down or we transfer to tapas because that where a lot of authors are going but I don\u2019t want to leave webtoons but just please give our authors the freedom and give us our stories back","1816":"The advertisement for Assassin Roommate was what pulled me to your app and I\u2019m glad I did I just started my interest for comics and it has a full variety of all genres. I don\u2019t like the fact that if you log on to some other device it doesn\u2019t have your exact bookmark on which chapter you left off.","1817":"This app is so good. It\u2019s very good to use in you free time when your bored because there are always new webtoons to chose from and the are almost always interesting. This is a very great app and I have no problems with it... except that they are so interesting (that was a compliment). Download this app now or else you will regret it!","1818":"Great comics and awesome app, just some suggestions- maybe something to keep track of how many webtoons we are subscribed to at once? I get why there is a limit to discover webtoon subscriptions but it's very annoying. Maybe make profiles so I can see what my friends are subscribed to and such\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d but good app I recommend it for boredom and emotions","1819":"The daily pass for completed series is utterly ridiculous. I understand wanting\/needing to make an income for both webtoon and the creators, but only allowing ONE episode a day(unless you pay real money) is just flat out ridiculous. I would understand it more if it were like 3 episodes a day, or maybe they only cost one coin an episode, but not 5coins an episode.\nWebtoon, you know this new setup is ridiculous and no one likes it. Everyone including me are begging that you fix it. Make it more reasonable if not non-existent.","1820":"I\u2019ve heard alot about this app. Great things, though I wish there was a way to upload from mobile. I started working on my \u201cmanga\u201d recently and I need a way to upload it. I found WEBTOON and wouldn\u2019t you know? Can\u2019t upload from a mobile device. I will continue using the app, I am just a little disappointed that I cannot upload my manga.","1821":"I love this app , it\u2019s so much to read ,I recommend getting it . I have a problem tho sometime this app kicks me off and I have to log in again and i have to subscribed to my series again which is not a problem but can you explain why it happens to me ?","1822":"I am a huge bookworm and I love this app. I am currently reading True Beauty and I\u2019m zooming through it. However, I can\u2019t read it now because my app keeps on crashing. Usually this is due to apps needing to update, however this one doesn\u2019t have to. I just want to mention crashing occurring on mine, which is the only reason I have it 4 stars. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95","1823":"Why can\u2019t the coins you buy just be in the app why can\u2019t my coins I pay for can only be used one device like that is so annoying to me also why can\u2019t I use my coins in different languages I think that is also dumb but overall my all isn\u2019t glitchy I don\u2019t ever get any bugs and I love the stories buttttt I\u2019m not rating this app off of stories they didn\u2019t create","1824":"I absolutely love this app the time and effort put into each episode of a comic is amazing a great way to have young people express there love for drama into art and a creative writing project. Personally I like the visual representation on this app as much as the reading the story lines are great the only thing is it is hard to wait a week at a time \ud83d\ude42","1825":"I read a large number of webtoons every day. There are so many to choose from that I would think anyone can enjoy quite a few series. This app is what keeps me sane throughout my work day. Without it, my mind would be lost. Lol. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone.","1826":"I love this app I literally don\u2019t sleep \ud83d\ude43 but there is one thing that I don\u2019t like with is the fast past episodes. Maybe make an app that\u2019s basically the same but you don\u2019t have to wait for the fast past episodes. Over all great app! I want too work there but not right now anyways thanks for making this app it makes me happy \ud83d\ude03","1827":"I have to wait so long one new episode and I don\u2019t have the money to buy tokens .I hate how you have to wait one whole week for a new episode .it literally took 4 years do you post 190 episodes, I know the authors need brakes and the stuff I just wish that the webtoons came out faster, I spent every day rereading waiting for a new episode....my whole life Unordinary what\u2019s the only thing I like to read...","1828":"I personally don\u2019t like comics I really don\u2019t but I love drama and WEBTOON has shown me a whole side of me that I didn\u2019t know I had and I love how if you can\u2019t afford fast pass you can read a new comic in just a week! Honestly all I have to say is if you like drama romance superhero\u2019s exc, then you should definitely get this app","1829":"Webtoon has always been an amazing app but just recently on some webtoons there are ads to watch before you read the next part of that webtoon but all the time the ads won\u2019t work and a lot of other people are having this problem. It always says try again later but you can never. FiX THE ADS PLEASe This is a month later from the part above me and they still don\u2019t let you watch one to continue the series thAnk you vEry mUch","1830":"The weeb inside of me is finally free to roam on the land of WEBTOON! I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for a year now, and it has never disappointed me. Getting to read my favorite stories before I go to bed every night has really helped me get through some tough times. Kudos to the canvas and original creators for putting their work out there! \u2714\ufe0e\u2714\ufe0e\u30b7","1831":"I went on Webtoon a bit earlier today and I was signed out somehow. After I managed to log back on, all my subscriptions (subscribed series) had disappeared, all gone, I have to resubscribe back to all the series I was reading. It\u2019s bothersome, had quite the few as well. Please fix this soon I don\u2019t want this to happen again, good app btw.","1832":"I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for a year, and I\u2019ve had no problems. But for the last day or two I haven\u2019t been able to open the app. I\u2019ll click on it and I immediately get booted back to my home screen. I only gave it one star because it\u2019s literally unusable now, otherwise it\u2019s great.","1833":"I love this game it gives so many different stories to read from and it allows lgbtq+ which not many apps do not only do I love it but so do my kids so now there not always playing games at least there actually reading now I don\u2019t even care if it has physical things in there best app ever","1834":"I love WEBTOON but recently when I go on the app it works for second then it freezes and it won\u2019t let me press any buttons I think it might be a bug in the app or a glitch I hope that the app gets updated and fixed so I can use the app again this Is  why I have i rate it a four star \u2b50\ufe0f review instead of five stars hope it gets fixed","1835":"Had the app for some time now and everything thing has been fine so far but recently for some odd reason the app will pop up the notification that there is no connection even though the internet works fine","1836":"I\u2019ve had this app for a long time on my devices and it\u2019s amazing.\nI have really bad anxiety at times but I love coming here to distract myself from my running thoughts, just put some music on and start reading and it always helps me calm down, I\u2019m so glad this app exists with out this app I would\u2019ve gone crazy haha \ud83d\ude01.","1837":"First and foremost I want to say I absolutely love this app, I\u2019m just here to suggest you add a new feature to narrow down the search for comics. I\u2019d appreciate it if you added completed to the shortcuts menu because It\u2019s hard to find all the completed webtoons in a certain genre just by scrolling through. Thanks","1838":"This app is so cool! It\u2019s fun to read all the comics. At some point though, they make you sign up or log in to finish the comic. No worries, but just one problem: IT WON\u2019T LET ME SIGN UP!! No matter how many times I type in my email (and I check it over and over to make sure I type it in right), it won\u2019t send me a \u201cconfirm\u201d email back, and it\u2019s frustrating! I want to read my comics, but it won\u2019t let me over a stupid bug.","1839":"I love webtoon great stories ,HOWEVER,the new policy had taken away ALL literally ALL the stories I read and there is SO MANY people like me who can\u2019t pay for patreon. And there are also creators who don\u2019t get to share their stories due to the new policy!!! I thought webtoon was supposed to be a place where people could share their ideas \ud83e\udd2c so much for trying to help people be creative!!!! I\u2019ve deleted the app all because of the new policy you have some gut to wipe away half the stories on The app.","1840":"This is an excellent app. I love all the stories and creativity in the stories. My only issue would be that when scrolling, the page gets stuck and you can\u2019t move anything in the screen. It\u2019s basically frozen. This forces me to close the app and enter again about 2-3 times each time this happens. It tends to happen very often.","1841":"Hi! I would like to ask a simple question, but first I will introduce myself. My name is Cody, and I am here to help WEBTOON with a certain feature. I\u2019ll just get straight to the point, ok? If a WEBTOON posts daily then it should show what day it will post somewhere in the screen where you pick the episodes. Thanks for listening to me, goodbye!","1842":"I love the stories, but the wait time is wayyy too long. It says I have to wait a day to read the next section, and for the section after that I have to wait 7 days then the one after that I have to wait 15 days. That\u2019s honestly ridiculous. That\u2019s really the only flaw with the app. I jus wish I could it the stories more often.","1843":"I love this app it\u2019s great but when I updated this app it signed me out of my profile and I didn\u2019t remember my sign in so I used Facebook but then when I did that I couldn\u2019t back out and had to close it and reopen it, and don\u2019t forget that I needed to subscribe to all my favorite comics please fix this it\u2019s really annoying and ruined a great app.","1844":"I rarely write reviews, but this app is the best!!! I only wish the developers would add a section in the my comics area to see what was updated that day. Especially when your reading a lot of comics at once. Other than that, 10\/10 would download again!","1845":"This app is amazing no doubt but the problem is whenever you move\/upgrade to a different device the chapters you read (indicated by darkening the chapter) don\u2019t transfer so for many WEBTOONs where I forgot to like the ones I read I don\u2019t know where I left off I think this is a simple problem to fix and would benefit both me and everybody in the WEBTOON community \nThank you!","1846":"i love webtoon. a LOT. but after this new update a lot of quality webtoon episodes have had to have been read on a different platform like patreon or tapas which totally takes away the ease and simplicity of webtoon. and anyways, it'll limit the creators from making a more realistic episode to a dumbed down kiddish version because of the 18+ update. young kids don't read much anymore, and i've tried to get a few interested but it's fruitless! please please change it back \u2764\ufe0f","1847":"I love this app. Such good comics. Is these anyway you can add \u2018Killing Stalking\u2019 or will the artist have to publish, I found the manga today and it\u2019s good. I used Lezhin website to read the first 2 episodes but I have to pay for the rest. Is there any other app\/website that will allow me to read the whole manga without paying??","1848":"I love WebToons. It offers so many awesome and intriguing stories and the new updates have been mostly good. The only thing that needs to be changed is that it has become difficult to determine what stories have been updated. Before the update it had a little green circle that said \u201cup\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d. I wish that was still there.","1849":"When I set this up it was awesome! all these comics that I could read at my fingertips. Until I started getting really peeved off at the fact that every time I try to stop the emails and or log in.... I CANT DO IT EVER. IT STATES IN YOUR HELP SECTION THAT I CAN DO THAT EITHER ON THE WEBSITE OR THROUGH THE APP AND IVE TRIED BOTH COUNTLESS TIMES. \n\nSo when you try this app out keep this in mind and remember I\u2019m not the only one having this issue and there is no where on the app that I\u2019ve seen that you can send a complaint about things like this. If I\u2019m wrong correct me I JUST WANT THE EMAILS TO STOP. \n\nThanks for reading! ~~~","1850":"I love webtoon, and it really is a great app. But, I   really don\u2019t think we should have to wait for daily  passes on a finished story. If all the episodes are released, why should we have to wait for a daily pass? I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair for us to have to wait for a daily pass, when the episodes have already been released, and are free to everyone.","1851":"Daily passes are extremely frustrating. I wanted to go back and read old classics and just to read it all I\u2019m going to have to wait months just to re-read it fully. I\u2019ve been using the app for 4 years now and they have been getting greedy lately so yeah. Otherwise enjoy and you might need to explore the 7 seas if you want to read something with daily passes.","1852":"I love this app so much! It\u2019s helped me get through some really ruff times, but when I read WEBTOON I always forget my worries! The comics are fun and exiting! Whenever I finish a series I have no trouble finding another because there are so many to choose from!  I recommend you download this app!","1853":"First of all this app is amazing!! Endless creative and amazing content. But today I went on Webtoon and saw an interactive banner for Not So Shoujo Love Story, Fluidum, True Beauty, and another Webtoon. I just wanted to say that was a SUPER creative interactive banner and it introduced me to a new Webtoon!! I hope you continue making banners that are interactive and fun like that :)","1854":"Why are you putting the daily pass on already finished stories? It\u2019s extremely aggravating to want to read one of my favorite comics from the beginning and being told after 4 years of having this app I need to pay for a comic that was finished 6 years ago. This newly added feature to daily pass is terrible and makes me not even want to buy it.","1855":"I love the app. I\u2019ve been using it for a bit over a year now and I had yet to find a problem with it. Until now... I used to be fine with daily pass until 3 of my favorite webtoons got daily pass on them. Now I can\u2019t even read them. It\u2019s really disappointing and I wish daily pass would be taken off the app.","1856":"The app is amazing! I haven\u2019t had problems until now. For some reason I can\u2019t get in the app. It\u2019s crashing before I can even get in the home page! Is this a bug? Is it just my phone? I really am missing out on my comics. It\u2019s been happening for a month now.","1857":"I absolutely love the app, and I\u2019m on it everyday! But I\u2019m having trouble getting onto the app. I thought I just to restart my phone and it would be alright. But once I click on the app icon, I\u2019m brought back to my home screen. I updated too! Is there anyway I can fix this?","1858":"I love WEBTOON\u2019s content but I have had issues in the past and currently with my device heating up and the battery continuing to drain more quickly than compared to when I do not use the app. It also runs in the background a lot and I cannot control that in a setting although this could probably be resolved by manually closing the app from multitask.","1859":"It\u2019s also draining my battery and often crashes when I binge read. My phone is pretty recent, so it can run apps without any problems most of the time. Is this going to fixed soon or is this something you are unaware of?\n\n(Also, the music doesn\u2019t play immediately sometimes, it just plays randomly even when the music is set to on)","1860":"I love superhero comics the most cause of unOrdinary which is why I did 4 stars ,  but theres still one problem which is that you need to login and make a account to get fast pass so please take that out and there are still bugs like when you press the app it takes so long to see your full screen , but apart from that I love it","1861":"I had to reset my phone and when I downloaded the app again I went to login and it said my email was not registered and so I went to create an account and it said my email was registered so please fix this issue, other than that this is a great app and I think anyone who downloads it will think so too.","1862":"So I love WEBTOON, it\u2019s amazing. I am a little bummed about the daily passes on completed WEBTOONs but it\u2019s alright. The thing is last week the app has been broken. It started from me not being able view my for you, but I just pressed on originals and canvas. Now, after I press skip sign in, I can\u2019t press anything else the screen is frozen. This isn\u2019t my phones problem because all my other apps are running just fine.","1863":"The app and all the comics are fantastic except for where it has loading issues and just lag issues and this isn\u2019t something that happened when I got it as it happened more suddenly so I hope they fix this issue","1864":"Hey. This is awesome... BUT! (You\u2019ll probably think I\u2019m babyish.) WHY do we have to wait for soooo long for the WEBTOON to update? I know. I know. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t really wait... \u2018Cause I\u2019m always impatient when it comes to books... You know? Some of you might agree with me...\n  ANYWAY!!! I love Tower of God, unOrdinary, SubZero, Lumine, Watermelon, Freaking Romance, Castle Swimmer. And many more...\n                      -Becky~","1865":"I loved webtoons when I was first introduced to it (before the coins and fast pass stuff), but this new update is stupid. I know it\u2019s been said over and over again in the reviews, but I would rather watch 2-3 ads before I EVER drop money into this app. I love the stories and all that, but I don\u2019t have the extra money to buy coins or whatever just to read the next episode or whatever. I really don\u2019t want to delete this app, but I might rethink that....","1866":"I would rate webtoon five stars because everything is really great but there\u2019s just one thing to make this a lot better you guys should add friends chatting and maybe comic making to your own app I feel that would be a great thing to be able to have in webtoon to make it a hole lot better I hope you take my review into consideration thank you.","1867":"I honestly just absolutely love this app! I\u2019m able to read many webtoons for free and if you want the flash pass it\u2019s not even expensive for the coins for the flash pass! Like I buy coins so many times cause it\u2019s so cheap. I\u2019m able to read ahead into the story then to wait into the next update !","1868":"Webtoon is my favorite thing to read, I love everything on there but the policy is so annoying. Not to be rude, I love the app but the policy has to move. I mean I don\u2019t the app just hate the rule. I mean I know it is 9+, but now it is getting boring a little. So can you please take that policy out for all the people 18+. Please and Thank you","1869":"So, I have had WebToons for a long time and Its a pretty good app. As most of the reviews say, I hate the no nsfw policy. I know this app is for 9+ which is quite dumb since most comics contain a at least a bit mature content. But whenever it was going to become a bit nsfw there would be a warning, asking if you\u2019re over 18 and most authors would warn you before the chapter starts too. Because of that I changed to a different app","1870":"I love reading Webtoon and seeing all the work the creators put towards their work and now that they added the no sexual content is so stupid even though I understand that it\u2019s to protect little kids but that\u2019s what their problem, it\u2019s a read at your own risk kind of thing and it should be removed!!!!","1871":"Ok what\u2019s up with you?! I can\u2019t log in at all! And then when I try to read it doesn\u2019t load and freezes up. This didn\u2019t use happen. I can\u2019t enjoy reading because the app doesn\u2019t allowed me to. And the place I have for login in won\u2019t even let me log in so I can continue reading. And I love the app I found so  many amazing authors who do so much wonderful comics. I\u2019m kinda disappointed.","1872":"I've been a fan of webtoons for years, and it has amazing content. But the new policy on NSFW content limits authors with what they can share. And it's not just \"no nudity\". You also can't post it censored. You also can't upload the chapters elsewhere, such as Smackjeeves. And these rules apply for discover webtoons. I feel like instead, it should be age-restricted on chapters instead. A lot of comics I really enjoy will no longer be posting anymore because of the new policy.","1873":"Look I like WEBTOON with all my heart but this new discovery policy is hurting creators work and I know people are probably righting a review like \u201cdon\u2019t stop my BL\u201d but I am worrying about my favorite artists and Authors and this new policy is going to get you bad reviews so please rethink about this and I send all my love and support for the wonderful people people that work at WEBTOONs\ud83d\udda4\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4","1874":"I started reading Webtoons about 3 years ago and got the app on my phone about a month or two ago. I love being able to have Webtoons wherever I go!! Super easy to navigate, awesome quality comics, this is one app you will never regret downloading! (Unless you spend too much time on it like me) \ud83d\ude01","1875":"The app is great! The stories are great, as well. I have used the app for a long while now. But what I don\u2019t like that has changed is that there is a pop-up add every time I finish an episode or chapter. It\u2019s frustrating because I just want to catch up on a story after not reading for awhile and I don\u2019t want to be interrupted after every chapter\/episode, especially the short ones. I don\u2019t know if this is for everyone, but I really don\u2019t appreciate this happening to me.","1876":"This is the best when u barely download cause you have all these great comics recommend dice    and unOrdinary but once you catch up with all the great ones you love the rest of ur day is pretty boring waiting each day for the updates and your excited to read but you read it too fast","1877":"I am always pleased with how intuitive and content filled this app is, there is almost a never ending selection of content that stirs the imagination and desire to come back everyday for more - the U.I. is intelligent and graphically satisfying, I can\u2019t say enough about this app and it\u2019s content, a very big thumbs up to the creators  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","1878":"This is a really great app for comic book lovers and has a lot of different types of styles for any reader and these comics are all free and fun to read I use this app more than any of my other apps anyone can use this app and is simple to learn what to do and after you read some it will come up with more that are like it.","1879":"WEBTOON is an amazing comic app, unlike the others that make you buy coins to read certain pages or read comics at all. One thing I don\u2019t understand is the 100 subscriptions cap. There\u2019s much more than 100 good comics on the app, and even if there weren\u2019t I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s a limit.","1880":"I usually use this for reading when I\u2019m bored and I check it frequently. The problem is that since I\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t really like leaving recents out to dry, I think a feature for deleting recents would be nice for those weird people who aren\u2019t a huge fan of cluttered recent Webtoons. It would be really nice to add this feature, thanks!!!","1881":"This app is my favorite for browsing through multiple comics\/webtoons and it has high quality translations for works from foreign authors. It would be even better if there was a feature that allowed us to upload and edit our webtoons on mobile. Basically, just bring the dashboard to mobile.","1882":"i love reading the comics posted on this app, but you really need to update the ipad version! it\u2019s hard to read the context on my phone, so i read mostly on my ipad. i want to be able to log in with my existing webtoon account, but i can only log in with line, twitter, or facebook. thus, i can\u2019t subscribe or even like any chapters on comics. it also doesn\u2019t bookmark where i was in the chapter, so if i exit out of the app, i lose where i was! also, if i leave the home page and then try to go back to it, it\u2019s an endless loading screen. please update the ipad version!\nother than that, i love it!","1883":"I starting getting annoyed at how many ads I got from this app, so I just HAD to check it out for myself! It is so amazing. It\u2019s like a virtual library yet it feels like your watching a movie. I just finished reading \u201cFreaking Romance\u201d by  Snailord, 10\/10 would read again. Download this app!! It\u2019s SOO with it! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","1884":"Y\u2019all need to seriously rethink your decisions on wattpad like what\u2019s the point of making it kid friendly when u know it\u2019s current impact and image is for reading mature content and for you to take that aspect away is just weird? Like just make another app then?? Wattpad has been like that for years and it\u2019s disrespectful to take away others enjoyment just for the sake of making it \u201ckid friendly\u201d some authors on wattpad use their stories to vent and for it to be taken down is just cruel freedom of speech b*txh","1885":"The daily fast passes are inconvenient when attempting to finish webtoons that I\u2019ve already started on another phone but are completed once i get another one. It is very frustrating because it can take multiple weeks just to get to the point I was at in the story. Other than that I think this app is amazing and easy to use with great stories.","1886":"This app is really awesome!!! It has addicting stories and amazing art. \nI loved it except when I finished the episodes and we had to wait for a new episode for like 2 weeks! You can buy the episodes with coins but the coins cost money and I don\u2019t want to spend money on this stuff. I love the story True Beauty but it takes way too long for the next episode to come out... it kinda makes me mad!","1887":"I was just wanting to read a WEBTOON when it said my internet wasnt working when my wifi is on full bars.I shut down my device and turn it back thinking it would work again but it didn\u2019t I\u2019m quite confused in this and getting me quite annoyed can you fix it please?","1888":"So I really wanted to read the new chapter or Lore Olympus so I went to pay for coins. It accepts my money from my Apple Pay but then said rejected. I checked my Apple Pay and it charged me 5 dollars for nothing. I tried to see my recent purchased and everything so I just got finessed of my money and I\u2019m really sad. I love this app but that was the small money I had and I didn\u2019t get my coins. Rip.","1889":"You\u2019d think a 300 sub limit would be more than enough for subscriptions on a comic app, but there\u2019s so many interesting things to read I hit it in only a few days just scrolling randomly.\n\nIf there could be a higher sub limit, such as 600, 1000, or (ideally) unlimited, this app could go from good to great.","1890":"I love that Webtoon is trying to get as much revenue possible for the artists but DAILY PASS? I\u2019m not against it or anything but I think it\u2019d be nice if it were like 10 or 20 eps a day? Because my friend just started noblesse and like it\u2019s gonna take him FOREVER to read it now, cuz of daily pass *sigh* he\u2019s a broke college student, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d be able to purchase the eps. Please either remove or revise the daily pass thing T^T","1891":"I\u2019ve seen a lot of reviews on the daily pass, I know I\u2019m only one person but everyone feels the same way about it and it needs changed. Like I said I\u2019m only one person, but this could easily lead to way less people reading and that\u2019s a huge profit loss for you, look at the reviews, no one likes it and no one wants it and you don\u2019t need it. Stop being greedy and take it away","1892":"I love this app so much. So entertaining when you\u2019re bored and you can even download the webtoons if you\u2019re going on a road trip. The only thing is that this app logged me out of my account out of nowhere. I tried my email and it did not work. All my data is gone and I was subscribed to maybe 60 webtoons. :(","1893":"I\u2019ve been using webtoon for a long time now and I love that app and everything but what\u2019s up with the daily pass? I like reading multiple stories at once and sometimes forget about others and today I went on to complete a webtoon that I never got to finish but it\u2019s COMPLETED and now there\u2019s a daily pass. I don\u2019t mind the fast pass but the daily pass might be a little too much :\/","1894":"A few years ago I downloaded this app and got hooked instantly!\nAs soon as my favorite comics update I read them immediately!(because I don\u2019t have money for coins) Overall, this a very great app a and I recommend other people download this app too.","1895":"I have been using WEBTOON for a really long time, maybe 3 years now, and low and behold all of a sudden I need to \u201cLog in\u201d but the log in saved on my phone doesn\u2019t exist. I had made a small purchase for my favorite webtoon series which I was really impatient for.. (you can read for free, or pay and read ahead) and all that in game currency is gone. \n\nKept in their pockets cuz all of a sudden I needed to be logged in. Can\u2019t remember ever having to. Lost all my coins, and my patience.","1896":"i love the mobile app because i can read on the go, and i love it when it notifies me when my favorite comic is updated! my only complaint is that i wish it wouldn\u2019t determined that i finished the chapter when i click on it. sometimes i\u2019m in the middle of a chapter and i need to stop suddenly due to life going on around me, so i wish it wouldn\u2019t determined that i finished it because when i go back, i forget that i didn\u2019t finished it and i click on the next chapter and i\u2019m totally lost. so, i wish it wouldn\u2019t determined that i was finished until i reached the end of the episode, not at the beginning.","1897":"To be honest I use to really like the app. Then they added the pass thing that was irritating. Now they are adding ads on comic. I cant even watch the ad it wont play. This is really sad. I have comics that updated last week and I can\u2019t even read them because the ads don\u2019t work and wont load. The only reason I use webtoon is to support the artists making the comics, but now I cant even do that because of the ads. Tragic.. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11","1898":"I used to love WEBTOON buta week ago it started to give me troubles. I had bought a bunch of fast pass thingies but nw they\u2019re all gone. And the app crashed so I had to uninstall it, I am installing* it again to see if it works this time. But again I love it! I started reading these after I found out Spaceboy was on this. *** update: I re downloaded it and now I signed into my webtoon account and none of my subscribed comics were there!! That is messed up. Now I\u2019m giving this a 2 star rating.\n:(","1899":"I don\u2019t know when this policy change went into effect, but now you have to watch ads to read some comics. But the freaking ads won\u2019t load, and the system won\u2019t let you read the comic without watching the ad first! This is ridiculous! I already fast-pass some comics hoping that the authors get the revenue (they probably only get a small portion), so it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t already making money off me, now this crap about being forced to watch ads is super annoying!","1900":"One thing is to make the waiting length shorter cuz I don\u2019t want to wait a week for a 2min episode and maybe like three days at the most and we should get Daily rewards like one coin everyday so we game save up and buy the episode that would make this game sooooooo much better so please just do these 2 things anyway love this app and good luck","1901":"I definitely recommend this app to all comic readers! Artists here work very hard to obtain the perfect comic you\u2019ll enjoy, the comics are quite unique. Every comic has deep meaning and will make you feel all types of emotions! It feels like your apart of a journey, so keep reading and support all comic artists! Promise this comic app won\u2019t let you down. \ud83d\udc9c","1902":"This app is amazing, but up until about a month ago I don\u2019t know why but the entire app shuts out, constantly. To the point where I can\u2019t even read\/enjoy my favorite webtoons, I hope this issue can be fixed soon because I always love to read comics on here!","1903":"I have had this app before so when I re downloaded it I tried to login but both of my emails didn\u2019t work. So then I tried to sign up but then both of my emails didn\u2019t work then either. I even tried my moms email. I don\u2019t understand the problem?","1904":"I love webtoons so much and it has some fantastic comics on there that will stay with you forever. But it\u2019s mainly catered towards romance and romantic drama which, after a while, become monotonous and infuriating. I have nothing against the authors or the people who love those types of comics, but, as someone who only reads like two, I do not enjoy every third webcomic advertised being a romance.","1905":"I love WEBTOON it has great stories. And also it\u2019s not like one of those apps where you have four passes and then you have to wait like another three hours to do it again also I don\u2019t mind having to wait for the episodes to come out! Just saying awesome app definitely recommend it!","1906":"I love webtoons so much! But theres a problem... the new policy for certain webtoon comics where it costs coins to continue reading, and its either you buy coins or you wait a very long time for the rest of the episodes. I\u2019m a very patient person, but its just tedious waiting and waiting for the days to pass by for your favorite comic to come out","1907":"So i'm one to\nlisten to music a lot in my daily life, but when I use WEBTOON it automatically pauses the music. It happens a couple minutes after I launch the app and when I put it back on it pauses again. Please fix this, I just want to listen to music and read some comics.","1908":"It\u2019s stupid how you have to wait a day to read 2 episodes , of something. Like y not make it all free so we can enjoy or At least give a membership that will give us that fast pass really doesn\u2019t help much to tbh. The creators r good and the app is good I just wanted to say how annoying it is to wait for something you want to read","1909":"Webtoons is amazing but the new policy is not.  A lot of other people and I don't agree with the new policy. If it's okay, could you please take it down? Edit: Okay that's it! A lot of my favorite authors are leaving BECAUSE of the new policy. I know you put they policy up so you can make the app a little more family friendly but there's a REASON why the authors put up 18+ warnings.\nI'm starting to have second thoughts about downloading Webtoons.","1910":"Personally, I love this app. The comics in here are beautifully made and they\u2019re addicting read. What really gets me annoyed is the fact that I\u2019m trying to read a new comic and it crashes. It\u2019s obnoxious and it takes away the excitement from that new comment feeling. This has been happening quite often even after multiple updates and it needs to be fixed. Thank you.","1911":"Omg I just love everything about WEBTOON I love the story\u2019s the creators the art from the creators it\u2019s just amazing I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it but I need to read things slower because every time I start reading a new comic I get so into it I finish it in a snap and it really takes my fangirling to a whole new level","1912":"It\u2019s wonderful I always find myself going back to the app as a lover for reading. I love the book feel but this app just has certain stories that you won\u2019t find anywhere else and keeps me interested app is well developed don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run into it with a bug.","1913":"To be honest I only downloaded this because it was the only ad I ever saw, and thought it would give me new ads if I downloaded. I DID NOT REGRET DOWNLOADING\ud83d\ude0d. I am LITERALLY ADDICTED to reading the stories, and I love that there are so many different types of stories. If you\u2019re think of downloading, my three favorite stories are Let\u2019s Play, Bastard, and Always Human.\ud83d\udc96","1914":"So far the only one I have read is True Beauty, but it seems like a really nice app. I don\u2019t get any adds either. I also love that I get to pick what genres I like. I think that is a really cool feature in this app. The story\u2019s are amazing. So, if you are into reading comic like books for free, I think you should download WEBTOON!","1915":"I like the apps and the story\u2019s people post. The rewards they give out is good too but recently the app has been acting up. It won\u2019t let me read the updates from comics I\u2019ve been reading. Another thing is that you wish to support but the only way is through patron. Still a good app with good comics.","1916":"I\u2019m gonna need for y\u2019all to fix this problem. I got logged out of my account and it told me NONE of my emails are associated with an account. I had to use the same email to create a new account. I really would appreciate it if you guys could fix this issue.","1917":"I had everything on my app set up fine (all my subscriptions and what not) and one day I opened the app and all my coins were gone and all my subscriptions were not there. It\u2019s now requiring me to sign up with an email. I just want my coins back so I can read chapters of my favorite WEBTOONs and not have to spend $30 again.","1918":"Ok first i love this app! It has sooo many addicting stories to choose from! When i was bored in quarantine this app was a LIFESAVER! Most of the stories update about once a week so you can look forward to every day! Now for my question...\n\nLets say I'm writing a webtoon.. how do i show it on the app?","1919":"honestly my experience with this app has been mostly great. I just think that the recommendations aren\u2019t the best. it\u2019s quite difficult to find new books that I like. i just think if they add a more accurate and beneficial recommendations section I\u2019d have no problems. keep up the good work webtoon!","1920":"1. I would love if they had a list of completed stories (similar to their lists of top picks)\n2. An archive for stories you\u2019ve finished reading would be amazing. I\u2019ve finished a bunch of stories that I\u2019d love to revisit later, and don\u2019t want to unsubscribe to. So an archive would be great to separate the ones I\u2019ve finished from the ones I haven\u2019t","1921":"This app is perfect for people who love all kinds of different genres of comics. Comics update weekly  and most leave amazing cliffhangers that make you come running back for more. There are hundreds of different comics to read and you can read as many as you\u2019d like at a time. Hope this helps.","1922":"Today I was reading and the app kicked me off idk why but when I press on the app it won\u2019t start idk if it\u2019s being fixed updated or it\u2019s just broken I\u2019ve tried turning my phone off and on restarting the app deleting the app then reinstalling it but nothing will work pls PLSSSSSS FIX THIS ALL MY BOOKS WERE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE THIS IS ALL I CAN READ PLS FIX THIS I BEG U","1923":"I love this app a lot! It has many cool story\u2019s that are interesting but now there are ads. And sometimes, it can\u2019t even upload the ads for me to watch so I can read the story, and that annoys me because then, I can\u2019t read my favorite comic\/ story. Hopefully you will see this, but overall, it\u2019s good. :)","1924":"Okay so idk if it\u2019s the new update y\u2019all just did, but every time I click on a comic to read, the screen goes to all white and the app freezes. This has never happened before and happened right after I updated the app. Please try to fix this?\ud83e\udd7a","1925":"I\u2019ve always liked reading but this is so much better. So many stories to read and so many different art styles. I\u2019m a beginning artist and everything is giving me so much inspiration to keep drawing because one day I can be as amazing as the artists on Webtoon. Love this app so much!","1926":"I love WEBTOON it\u2019s a great app I think all the comics are good and different I think they should add a recommendation box or somewhere where us readers can pitch ideas to the creators a win win for both if you ask me the reads get to read what catches their attention and the designers never have to really be stuck on one idea","1927":"I love the app, it\u2019s updated quite frequently and is enjoyable, but there is an issue with the current coin event going on right now.\nOn day 6, my progress was randomly reset to day 1 on November 15th, and again on November 19th, or today. I was kinda hoping I could get my progress back, or at least for the bug to be fixed...","1928":"I love the stories I read them so fast but the original stories have some episodes locked and you need to buy coins or wait 7-30 days for them to be unlocked and the coins are pretty expensive and I hate it, I know they need to make money but really it\u2019s just cruel having to wait to read a story","1929":"Angry because it said one more day for a new episode then the next day it said the same thing it said yesterday l don\u2019t like that am super angry and why do you need a account for this anyway but l am most angry about the episode thing but over all it\u2019s nice a love True Beauty it\u2019s very cool but that is the one that said the episode thing so fix the stupid bug!\n\nUpdate now there is this new bug when l try to delete a series and it will not delete then it freezes please fix if it keep happening l will have no choice but to delete the app","1930":"So I LOVE the app which is why I\u2019m giving it a four star rating, but I have a problem. I switched over to a new phone and I logged in to my account to see that it kept the comics I was subscribed to, but not the episodes I\u2019ve already read. This is a problem because I DONT KNOW WHERE I PAUSED ON EACH COMIC, and I don\u2019t want to have to reread them so if you could. PLEASE fix this. Thank you!\ud83d\ude0a","1931":"Whenever I try to sign in it says that I will get a confirmation email in 60 minutes but I never get an email even tho I\u2019m putting in my email correctly, and for some reason on my old account it logged me out, and I don\u2019t remember my password, so I tried to make a new account but doesn\u2019t work.....","1932":"I love all the comics and how it works.  But I have one problem and that is I don\u2019t understand how to upload a comic!  And people say there is a publish button but I\u2019m not completely sure.  If there is a way, can you please make it more obvious? If you could that would be amazing.","1933":"I was reading WEBTOON until at a point I got kicked out of my account and I tried the password but it did not put me back in. When I signed up with the same email it said \u201c email already signed \u201c so after I tried like a lot of passwords that could be the correct one I failed.+ when I pressed \u201c forgot password \u201c you only get to send the request to an email, not a phone number.","1934":"Exactly as the caption above says.\n\nMy phone is up to date, but it still won\u2019t let me log in with my account. It\u2019ll pause for a second and afterwards I cannot click any of the social media bubbles anymore, only the x button.\n\nDon\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so I tried other methods. I tried to make another account, but it said my email was being used. Then I tried to log in with the same email, it said there was no email like that in their systems. I\u2019m getting super frustrated.","1935":"But I can\u2019t even view, let alone edit, my own webcomic that I\u2019ve been posting on my laptop. Well, look LINE, sometimes I want to be able to edit and view my webcomic\u2019s stats on my phone while I\u2019m on the go, because I don\u2019t always have my laptop with me. This kind of feature would be great and improve the app a lot for creators like me. Other than that, though, two thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","1936":"I really love this app it always have good comics and genres you can love. Throughout the day at least one or two comics update and then at 9 pm is when the mostly update. I really love this game for the comics and different authors, if your thinking about getting this app I totally recommend this to anyone and even you!\ud83c\udf37\ud83c\udf37\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0b","1937":"This App has so many exciting storys, and I'm always watching my notifications to see what updates and when! All of the authors have different drawing styles and different Genres, but they all are amazing either way. I highly recommend Webtoon for anyone that likes to try new, fun, and interesting things.","1938":"With many online comic apps you have credits or points or in app cash or have to pay real money to read comics... Webtoon is THE BEST because you can read unlimited for free for as long as you want! You can literally read a thousand chapters a day and they don\u2019t stop slow or judge you. It\u2019s amazing. Other comic apps don\u2019t compare.","1939":"Absolutely love the app and all the different peoples art and story work, only thing is I am a artist\/story writer and unable to get a computer. I hope there\u2019s another app you guys will make or a feature to add on that allows people like me to just upload work from their phones \n\n                   Much admiration, M\ud83d\ude80","1940":"This app really is great overall and I love all the stories but I somehow got 2 extra coins that I don\u2019t think I bought or earned for no reason (but I\u2019m not complaining) and can\u2019t they tell u if someone likes or replied to ur comment? It\u2019s hard to go to your inbox on WEBTOON and scroll through all your comments trying to find a certain one.","1941":"I love all most of the stories they recommend I love how they have recommended\u2019s for you even for art, the app is really good I haven\u2019t had any problems yet, the stories are really good. I personally don\u2019t mind the daily pass I know a lot of people do, but overall the app is good has drama romance thriller that\u2019s AMAZING. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude02","1942":"Overall a really good app, one feature I really appreciate is that if a webtoon has suggestive content or something not quite appropriate for 13 yr olds it will warn you and ask you if you would like to read it. Thank you that makes browsing comics so much more fun and easy!","1943":"You make money off all these Artists, yet your app is still virtually unchanged, problems and all. My favorite re-occurring problem is when you advertise some dumb event to read some random series, you have a little box to check that says not to show me again.. I like that I click it every time it pops up, yet it still comes back every time. I\u2019m going to start reading the comics on the artist\u2019s instagram pages, thanks for all the ads and unregulated comments!","1944":"It\u2019s great! You get to read lots of awesome mangas\/comics or whatever. It\u2019s great even tho you have to wait one or two weeks sometimes for a new episode and you have to wait a whole day for a fast pass. I would really recommend it! So make sure to check this app out!!!","1945":"the two episode daily pass for completed series is what really ticks me off, when you complete a series and want to re read it it becomes annoying having to wait a DAY to read two episodes you have ALREADY read. please remove the two episode cap for already completed series","1946":"Been using this app for years now, but the daily pass is the worst thing they could\u2019ve added. I was fine with the fast pass for the 3 or so recent episodes, but this daily pass is what will kill this app. More people will go to piracy sites and they will be forced to remove the daily pass. It honestly baffles me why they even thought they could get away with this and not get immediate backlash from the USERS OF THIER OWN APP. Until they delete this I probably won\u2019t be using WEBTOON and just use a piracy site.","1947":"I love the app, but yesterday I got kicked out of my account and can\u2019t sign back in. I thought if I wait it\u2019ll fix\u2019s itself but, NOPE. I now have to manually go through my subscribe comics, to see if they updated or not. I don\u2019t know if anyone else ever had this problem but I\u2019ve had webtoon for almost a year and a half, but this has never happened to me before.","1948":"I love the app, I really do, but I wish I could upload my own comic from mobile. I don\u2019t have access to a computer, and because I have helicopter parents I don\u2019t have access to desktop site mode. Other than that, the comics are great and I love to talk to the creators that respond! It\u2019s such a good community in there of amazing people!","1949":"I love Webtoon but I wish they would take the daily passes off of completed series.I want to be able to binge a series in a day or two. But having the daily passes makes me have to wait like a month to be able to finish a series with like fifteen episodes.","1950":"The recent updates just keep getting worse & worse. The ad to read a comic is just annoying & the daily pass is just straight up stupid. Most of these comics go into the 100s & no one is going to wait 100 days to finish reading a comic, thats just unreasonable. You could do ads for coins which would be way better & probably more beneficial to the app & the readers.","1951":"Why do I have to pay to read ahead on completed webtoons??? Being able to only read one episode a day and not be allowed to binge read is extremely annoying. If I do use coins to read ahead quickly it would be extremely expensive and FOR WHAT. The episodes becomes locked again after 14 days. This stupid feature will just cause people to not read the webtoon anymore or get it pirated from somewhere else...","1952":"I actually love webtoon I\u2019m so blessed by its existence, I\u2019m just here to warn you about something no one is talking about: DO NOT GO TO LINKS PEOPLE COMMENT!!! They will send you to a website (usually porn or nudes) that you might want to never see! Other than that I love this app and I am reading over 40 different comics. \ud83e\udd70","1953":"This app is soooooo good it has everything you need or want to read it has different varieties but they each have one thing in common. They\u2019re all funny and serious at times I would always support this app and all the creators on the app","1954":"I love webtoons, they're one of my favorite pastimes, so i finally got the app. It worked for about two days, and next thing i know every time i open the app it crashes. i deleted the app and got it again, nothing. i restarted my phone, nothing. Nothing works! Now I have to go back to the website version. I don\u2019t really mind, just the website doesn\u2019t work very well.","1955":"This was good at the beginning all the stories were interesting but for me out of no where this app started crashing and wouldn\u2019t even let me open it it would instantly crash even if I rebooted my phone or deleted the app and re-downloaded it. I\u2019m not sure if this is only me or if this is happening to others. Please fix this so I can go back to reading stories.","1956":"I participated in the Tower of God challenge and read 100 episodes but when the 23rd came around, I closed the pop up because I was in the car using my data it was taking too long to load. I thought I\u2019d be able to get the pop up again once I re loaded the app but nothing came up. While I enjoyed the series, it was quite upsetting to not be able to get the coins promised. Is there any way I can get that pop up again?","1957":"I\u2019ve never had any complaints about this app, but I  opened my app today and I was logged out! I was very upset because I had to resubscribe to all of my favorite WEBTOONs and it made me restart the daily login challenge. I hope this gets fixed so that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. But overall I really love this app and all of the artists!","1958":"I LOVE it! It gives me (a very busy college student) a chance to escape. It only takes a few minutes, so I\u2019m not stressed about spending too much time away from my responsibilities. I also adore the stories. There\u2019s so many different art styles and plots. I\u2019m always to eager for the next episode.","1959":"I love this app, I\u2019ve had WEBTOON since middle school, and it got me through a lot.I love the variety of comics it has, and I love how the comics can make you connect with the character, and how each author makes their on story. It\u2019s just saddens me that the comic Familiar got cancelled, I wish it would come back sometime soon. \ud83d\ude14","1960":"I\u2019ve had this app for about a year now and it\u2019s a really great app, the new update how ever has messed up the app, due to the fact like when your reading the app with freeze and shut down every 5 minutes. I haven\u2019t found a way to fix it but other than that it\u2019s a really good app there\u2019s hundreds of comics to choose from\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","1961":"I\u2019d give it a five if it weren\u2019t for the fact that mobile users have to upload their comics on a pc. I wanna be a part. But other than that WEBTOON is amazing because of its wide variety and the fact that it\u2019s so big and has so many creators on it! If I wanna upload my comic I have to do it on a PC. To me I think it should be able to upload on any platform.","1962":"After downloading the most recent update, the app is constantly crashing on my phone. I\u2019m not even able to open it before it crashes. Before I updated it, the app worked perfectly and I used it almost daily. I love the app, I just hope there\u2019s another update to fix this issue.","1963":"Why bring in adds now it\u2019s super irritating they lock my phone up and I have to close the app and reopen it. I still love the WEBTOON\u2019s I read here and that the only reason I gave a 4 Star if you was going to bring in adds do it right and not lock peoples phones I have other apps that have pop up adds and it doesn\u2019t lock my phone.","1964":"I find it really aggravating when I am looking for comics called girl love after typing in gl half of those comics are unavailable or deleted another half of those are either boy love or not even love stories at all and 1\/5 of them are actual girl love to top it all off boy love has over 1,000 comics (that mostly all work) and girl love has 566 minus a lot and then some of the ones that look good are age restricted and you have to pay money monthly just so that you can become a Patreon to read and catch up with the comic","1965":"I just got on WEBTOON to read some cool stuff, like I do every day, and saw something I hadn\u2019t seen before. Their where episodes that you could purchase for early reading using in app currency. I don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t know what exactly I don\u2019t like about it, but I do know that from now I\u2019ll always be \u201cbehind\u201d on my favorite comics and the only way to be caught up is to pay real world money. This new feature makes me sad.","1966":"The site itself is great, I love all the comics I read on here, lots of great stuff. However, for some reason the app will freeze from time to time and not let me do anything as soon as I open it. Today it was working fine, it had been for several days now, but then it suddenly froze up and now every time I try to open it, it will freeze on the homepage and not work.","1967":"This was my favorite app and I loved reading my web comics on this app. But when it made the NSFW update it ruined everything and many of my favorite comics have stopped posting on the platform because there comics were not allowed anymore. This makes me so sad. And now I am considering stopping using the app because my favorite stories have left. Please change back. Or make there have to be warnings or something. Please many people have been upset sense the change. Thank you for reading.","1968":"This is an amazing app!! I've been using it for a few years now and I found amazing stories in here but I am begging you to please change the subscription to 300 canvas series to unlimited. I've recently been having to unsubscribe to species that I read and then have to find them on different platforms","1969":"I\u2019ve been reading comics on this app for almost a few years, and I can honestly say I love it. The viewers are so supportive and the creators show diversity, not only artistically and in the storytelling, but also truths about themselves. The creators even put themselves at risk, just to make us great content. Please support this company and app!","1970":"I love how you can read the webcomics without having an account and how you do not have to pay for anything it has what everybody wants and needs if you like horror the got it if you like dark humor they got that ( I suggest Hapi Buni) and if you like to ship they got that too! ( for you shippers I suggest sirens latement)  five stars for sure!","1971":"Hello! I absolutely love WEBTOON and the stories on there but when I fast pass to get an episode it would really improve everything if the time I have to wait for the other episodes would go down. It\u2019s a tad annoying having to wait even LONGER to see another episode after paying to see one earlier.","1972":"I love love love this app!! I have read so many great stories and something I love is you can find something for all ages. Of course it\u2019s not perfect and sometimes things can glitch but that rarely happens and doesn\u2019t take a star away for me, I definitely really recommend this!!","1973":"I think that Webtoon might be the best thing the ever happened to me. It has made me happy, sad, angry, and much much more.I recommend Heartstopper( I cried), Let\u2019s Play(Team Charles), The Kiss Bet (Team Subway Boy),and Stupid Question(Go Get Your Man). I still can\u2019t express the love that I have for Webtoon. \n\nHalf of these are BLs and the other half are drama.","1974":"I think this app is great. The quality is great, the stories are great. The only thing is that I don\u2019t know how to change it to English. Like I know this is a Korean app but I feel like Korean stories are more emotional and stuff but I cannot read it. So if you can help me change it to English that would be great. Otherwise everything is amazing about this app!","1975":"I really loved binging all the comics and webtoon is starting to be like wattpad trying to us to wait for 3 months for a story that\u2019s already finished. It\u2019s frustrating when all my favorite comics I have are now needed to be read once a day and that takes too long the feature. As much as i love the comics i\u2019m not willing to pay or wait 2 months to read it all especially when it the chapter locks up again after 14 days.","1976":"WEBTOON is really free like you could read anything. Drama, Romance, Creepy it\u2019s all in there. I love webtoon my favorite story is Freaking Romance it\u2019s really cool and magical. I showed it to my family and my family were happy because I never read so now my family is happy because I\u2019m reading now because of webtoon Download it it\u2019s really free!!!","1977":"I love this app and I read a lot of WEBTOONs on it, but recently they have made it to where you have to watch videos to get the next episode, but the videos almost never work so I end up getting behind on the webtoon. Also, I have completed their challenges to get the free coins and never received the coins. Please fix this soon so I can go back to enjoying this app.","1978":"Hands down the dumbest thing they have implemented this app is nothing but a money grab at this point waiting a week for new chapters is whatever but restricting already completed series does nothing but hurt the authors who wanna show the work they\u2019ve put in for a long time off to new readers and restrict people who have already read those series and just wanna re read there favorite webtoon honestly I don\u2019t think anyone is a fan of this new feature","1979":"I am EXTREMELY upset with this new update.\n\nI have been using Webtoon since 2015 and have always been very happy with the app. When they added coins I was fine with it and it was understandable for stories that were new and still being updated. \n\nBut to pay for stories that I\u2019ve already read multiple times?! Not only that but to have one chapter available a day?! Even though the series is COMPLETE. And on top of that once you pay if you wish to reread the ONE chapter again after 2 weeks you have to REPAY?! This is just a way to make more money from the company and in my opinion, greedy. \n\nAs a follower and supporter of webtoon since 2015 I am EXTREMELY upset and likely will no longer support this app unless this changes back for completed series.","1980":"So I never had this app. And when I downloaded it i put in my email and password. And they said this email is taken. And no one has my password or email. Then I tried my google account and it still not working. I\u2019ve tried every email I had and nothing. You really need to fix this app.","1981":"So this app is anime. I like it, but one change I want. They have some background music, but when I put the music the first time and I continue the story...It still has no music. I have to try like 2-3 tries to put the music. I have to put silent mode 2-3 tries too. It kinda annoys me because I love anime and drama. I love stories too. Hope it\u2019s better!","1982":"Don\u2019t get me wrong I love this app but I do not like the wait, But overall I really love this app. I love the story quality and the sound effects make it 10 times better. It is a good app for people who are over 13 and I love the contrast and the overall quality of the app so 100% recommend.","1983":"The read 100 chapter to get 5 coins is so annoying. Because of it when I\u2019m at the end of the chapter, they would show a pop up that I can\u2019t even close. If I want to go to the next chapter I have to close the app and click on the next chapter from the table of content. Honestly it\u2019s so annoying. I would rather read somewhere else than webtoon just because it\u2019ll be a more enjoyable experience","1984":"I love this app and i love the cliff hangers so the story draws you in and you keep reading it and not getting bored with the story This app sometimes gets a little bug but nothing to worry about because you get your bookmark so you know we\u2019re you left off. All and all this app is amazing!!","1985":"Great app, maybe even one of my favorites! A lot of apps similar to this make you use coins to unlock the content, but it\u2019s nothing like that in this app! All I\u2019ve seen are some pop-up adds. Plus, I love the wide variety of genres, and that anyone can post comics on WEBTOON. I absolutely love this app; it\u2019s what really got me into comics.","1986":"So the app is having some issues and supports is nothing but an email you can\u2019t really respond to. While I am working to get back all my fast passes I have bought and the coins that have all disappeared I found that my card has been charged again this morning. And they email saying I should hear from someone in 24 hours...... so stupid. And not getting to read any of the fast passes is a double slap.","1987":"I love WEBTOON and I had for a year now but I wish you could publish on any device I have an iPad and I would love to publish my things on there but it won\u2019t let me and yes I have a pc but it\u2019s broken and I don\u2019t have the money to get it fix so I hope WEBTOON could let me post on any device but I still love the app it\u2019s good and you should download it","1988":"Please allow users on MOBILE to upload their comics. I don\u2019t own a desktop, and when I try to use the desktop site on my iPhone, the files just won\u2019t load despite following the recommendations! I really just want to share my comics to the community, and it\u2019s unfortunate that I can\u2019t because I own a phone.","1989":"You have probably got a lot of complaints about this already, the new policy, i miss the old webtoon where i didnt have to pay 20$ to patron just to see one little scene thats important to the storyline , this used to be a free place where we could read and draw what we wanted and now you are putting restrictions on us \ud83d\ude14, I really used to love this app but its just not the same anymore, its not fair to the artists who put their effort into creating these comics and its not fair to the readers.","1990":"I love this app! The only down side to this app is that it crashes every other time I try to go to the next chapter. It shows that it\u2019s loading then the buttons disappear. Then I can\u2019t even scroll. The only way to fix it is to reload the app. Yet, it will crash again. I will do it again and again just to read the amazing webtoons though.","1991":"I love WEBTOON it\u2019s amazing and the authors are great but they added this thing where to read passed a certain point you have to buy coins or wait a ridiculously long amount of time to read the next chapter.  I loved this app because I got to read wonderful stories while looking at unique and gorgeous art, but now the whole thing is kind of ruined because I can\u2019t afford to constantly buy coins to read; some of us are on a budget.","1992":"I love it! I was never a korean fan or anything like that. But meeting u guys was everything my cousin begged me to see this once so i did and.  It. Was. Life. Changing i am not even overreacting right now. Lol. So anyway i really recommend for anyone who likes reading comics and yea. Animation is on point. Like five stars.  I qish i could give u ten or twenty or a MILLION. Love Alisha","1993":"So I love the webtoon app it\u2019s great for reading comics and find new things to read. But I hate the policy on no 18+ content. It makes it hard for some authors to continue the stories and i get it, you want the app safe for children but it\u2019s the child\u2019s fault if there parents find some 18+ content and wrote an angry review. Cause that\u2019s on the kid if it clearly says 18+ but overall it\u2019s a great app","1994":"Dear webtoon\nCan we just take coins for free or by watching ads cause a lot of people can\u2019t purchase for the coins and there are a lot of awesome stories like (SAVE ME BTS) but ep 4 and 5 cost 5 coins (Each) so If we could take coins by watching ads or doing anything else it would be better than purchasing \nThanks.","1995":"I love this app and all of its amazing, heart warming, thrilling, fun, funny, and tearful stories, reading Webtoon is they best time of my day Because when I am feeling down couse of what\u2019s happening in life then I start reading Webtoon and it puts a smile on my face reading about these character\u2019s lives and stories... and I\u2019m NOT making this all up!","1996":"Everything about this app and it\u2019s community is absolutely fantastic. I fall in love every day when I see the notifications stating that a story a creator has put their heart and soul in has updated for me to read. Now I only there was an app for move writers this well done and respectful and fantastic!\nGreat job guys!","1997":"I love this app I\u2019ve been using it for about a year and a half now and I love all the story\u2019s I read and how great the quality is and how the creators can read our (the readers) feedback but I am unhappy with the constant changes of policy\u2019s as it is always changing and it messes with the writers and the readers as the stories have to change and they can\u2019t show some things which can be vital to a story.","1998":"Honestly I really love WEBTOON and it\u2019s really fun and nice thing to use and not spend money, but the new policy for NSFW\/mature content is just insane. These artists worked hard to make these and now they have to take away their hard work. And even if they censor it and everything, they still have to take it down. I honestly think that WEBTOON shouldn\u2019t have done that because it kind of ruined it for me.","1999":"Okay, let me just say that i love webtoon. Its the app that i always use whenever and it always makes me happy, but since their latest policy update saying that they are banning nsfw, its been affecting the authors of MANY BL\u2019s i read. It is taking some of the enjoyment out of reading them and it\u2019s really annoying. I'm writing this review because i don\u2019t want the authors to have to stop writing their story\u2019s just because of this. I really hope webtoon changes this policy.","2000":"I got a great app that does have adds but they are only for the most recent episode and if you wait a few days you don\u2019t have to watch a add. Edit Plz add it so we can choose more things to search like i could put thrilled and slice of life to search to see if any comics are both. EDIT!! Please put more thrillers and mystery comic.","2001":"I love webtoon it's my favorite app it lets me read all my favorite comics and has minimal ads(it has a few at the bottom of episodes but they don't take much if any of your time) I also love all of the great genres that webtoon has to offer, with all of the webtoons there are there is something for everyone.","2002":"I really do love this app, but there is a small issue with my Subscribed Webtoons list. I follow a lot of comics so my list is really long. When I scroll down and open a comic, and exit out, it resets back to the top of the list. So I have to scroll all the way back down where I left off. None of my other friends seem to have this issue, and I didn't either until I updated.","2003":"This is getting ridiculous. I was in the middle of rereading Miss Abbot and the Doctor a while ago and it became a daily pass series. Now I don\u2019t have the ability to read it all in one sitting because the episodes expire after 14 days too. I understand the need for daily pass revenue but why have the episodes expire. It\u2019s extremely frustrating watching this app turn into a flashier tapas. What happened to the Webtoon we had in 2018?","2004":"Screw daily passes. Seriously.\n\nI understand that daily passes on completed stories are there in order to generate revenue on series that no longer have fast passes. However, locking users to 1-2 passes a day is ridiculous.\n\nI will not read any completed Webtoons with the crappy daily pass system, because reading 1-2 chapters a day is garbage. I already like to wait weeks\/months for updates so that I can binge-read, and the daily pass system is only exacerbating this annoyance by extending the waiting to finished series.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why they have big piracy warnings up on their Webtoons now. It\u2019s because they\u2019re fully well-aware that their increasing greed will drive users to illegitimate sites with reasonable policies. \n\nGet the greed under control. One star until then.","2005":"This used to be one of my favourite apps. Convenient. Easy to read especially with dyslexia. But this fast pass crap is over done. Went from free episodes until caught up then coins to skip ahead , to 3 episodes a day until caught up, and now only one free episode?? And when I miss a day I can\u2019t even retrieve it. It\u2019s gotten me back to not even loading up WEBTOON anymore.","2006":"This is a stunning app, nothings wrong with it in my opinion, everything seems reasonable. I definitely recommend this app for anyone looking for a manga to read. This manga has so many unique stories that can make you want to read more, this app is 5\/5 stars in my opinion.","2007":"I\u2019m a new reader and a lot of completed webtoon that are really good apparently have daily pass and it kind of makes me angry that i need to wait about 2 months just to finish a completed series like please just let us binge the completed series then it would be 5 star but the daily pass isn\u2019t really that good and many people agree to remove it","2008":"I love Webtoon, but there is a new thing on called \u201cdaily passes\u201d for already completed webtoons. I feel like it is limiting the amount you read for no reason. The comic is finished so you should be able to binge it and not have to stress about new episodes coming up. It was already released so why do we have to wait for it to release again. If this was not apart of the app, it would be am easy 5 stars.","2009":"So I love this app, I read comics on it everyday! However, when I went to open the app it just closed on me! I tried again and again but couldn\u2019t get in. I reset my phone but it didn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bug or something, but I hope it isn\u2019t permanent.","2010":"I\u2019ve been using WEBTOONs for about 2 years now. When I logged in today all my information was gone including my subscriptions and my coins. It won\u2019t let me log back in as it says my email is not a registered account. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on but it\u2019s very frustrating after how much money I\u2019ve invested into this app.\nUpdate- I have not been able to get a response from LINE customer care.\nUpdate - it\u2019s had been almost 3 months and nothing has changed.","2011":"This is the best comic app i have up until recently I\u2019ve had no bugs nor problems. Now when I get on the app it says it has trouble connecting even when I change the WiFi I am using other than that small problem I love the app and all the comics!","2012":"I love all the stories especially I love you and ghost theater but I have some questions about the what do you like thing can you go back and like I chose Romance but not horror and now I want horror can you go back to that and I love the game again and how did you come up with this game cuz it\u2019s a good thing you did anyway have a great day bye","2013":"this is amazing. i love all the stories and makes it easy to find specific stories or genres that i would like to read. but i really do not like that whenever i go in through the website, with the same account i use on my phone, it does not save where i had previously left off. the same with my phone. i accidentally deleting the app and when i re-downloaded it my bookmark were gone. and i was confused on where i had left off. my subscriptions were saved and everything else was fine, but the bookmarks. i hope you can fix this problem:) thank you for your cooperation.","2014":"The stories are good but once they changed the coins to fast passes the app hasn\u2019t been the same. I haven\u2019t read any stories for a few days but still check in to get fast passes, and the amount of passes I have changes daily. Yesterday I had 19 AFTER check-in, and today I only had 17 BEFORE check-in. It keeps subtracting passes even though I haven\u2019t used them.","2015":"I love this app so much. The only thing is that there\u2019s a bug where my screen just freezes when I try to click another WEBTOON. I then have to close the app and then open it again. It\u2019s just really annoying having to do that every time I want to go to a different series. Hope this gets fixed soon!","2016":"I absolutely love this app. There are a lot of books to read but i wish there was a way to earn coins to read ahead sooner instead of having to buy them. If there was a way to earn them instead i would give this a 5 start rating. But either way i love this app and love the books in it!","2017":"I love using this app to read so many amazing stories but I really don\u2019t love that you have to use your money to read more of the story. If I wanted to do that I\u2019d just go buy a real book. I understand people need to make money but I also don\u2019t want to have to pay or wait weeks to read another short chapter in a story","2018":"I\u2019ve been using your app for a long time and it\u2019s awesome! But you could do better if you had some way to allow users to earn coins (for example: users will earn a coin for completing an episode) instead of having to purchase them.","2019":"I love this app, and I love the ability to read the comics I love but, I don\u2019t enjoy the fact that it crashes in the middle of me reading one. It\u2019s consistent now when it would only happen so often and it\u2019s getting a little annoying. Please fix this.","2020":"It\u2019s a great app and I use it quite a bit but it freezes really often. Like every 2-3 chapters it will freeze to the point where I need to restart the app. I mean I can get around and deal with it the first few times but it is really annoying when it constantly freezes.","2021":"The app was great and the comics are so awesome but the new policy has to go it is so annoying and it causes authors to lose their story\u2019s or have to remake them to fit your new policy and sooner or later this app is going to lose stars and people will start deleting your app then you\u2019ll be that one app that was popular but now only has one and a half stars","2022":"So I had my update recently on my iPad, but webtoon won\u2019t let me read the comics?! I have to download the iPhone version and I have to click on the comics like vertically. However the iPad version gives you it in a horizontal view of reading. So please do something about plz. My wifi is connected well and It\u2019s good. So Maybe the update is blocking it?","2023":"Idk I just thought I should rate it I mean it is really great and you don\u2019t have to make an account for it so people that have troubles making an account with their email just read because you don\u2019t need a account (also I suggest you read Siren\u2019s Lament, Lumine, UnOrdaniary Boyfriend of the dead, True beauty and age matters)","2024":"I love webtoon and all the stories they have to offer. But the reason I got it and enjoyed it so much is cause it was free unlike a lot of other apps. I can't pay anytime I want to read the new chapter but like many others, I don't wanna wait either. I sincerely hope they change this because it's just ridiculous. I'm sure other users can agree.","2025":"I love WEBTOON and when I found out I could read farther into the comics I liked I was excited. However I tried buying coins 2 times now and every time it took my money but didn\u2019t give me the coins in exchange. I did however try again for the third time and it gave me coins. But where\u2019s my other 20 coins? Please let me know if there\u2019s anyway to get the coins I payed for","2026":"I downloaded the app and absolutely fell in love with the story Castle Swimmers (I recommend it 100% btw) but now I\u2019m stuck only being able to read one episode a week? Of course I could pay to read them faster but they could at least release 2 episodes a week.","2027":"Ever since the IOS 12 update, WEBTOON has stopped working on my Ipad Mini. It appears that the iPad app hasn\u2019t been updated in a very long time, however, in this version it is very uncomfortable and inconvenient for IPad users. I have trouble seeing things on a small screen, so I have always used my iPad for WEBTOON. I\u2019ll bring my review up to 5 stars, the rating it deserves, when I can read WEBTOONs again, either on this version or the iPad one.","2028":"WEBTOON gave me a lot of enjoyment and excitement! But the new policy is really crushing my spirit. There are some authors of many good story\u2019s and due to the new policy they have either have to change the storyline or just take down the story altogether. A lot of time has been spent on creating these story\u2019s and for their hard work be taken down is heartbreaking. As a reader I can only imagine what an author has to go through to make such a great story, so I\u2019m sure for the authors and their stories to be restricted is heartbreaking as well. Please WEBTOON fix the policy.","2029":"The recent policy change regarding sexual suggestiveness in comics has ruined the structure of MANY creations all around WEBTOON. It\u2019s honestly a huge blow to my reading library of subscriptions as well as many others as I have seen through many comments. It\u2019s leaving much reason to stop using WEBTOON all together because so many good works are having to end early. We want the old WEBTOON back! It was a safe place! Now there is little to enjoy. Please give us the old policy back! We want WEBTOON as it was! It\u2019s best form for all!!!","2030":"I used to adore webtoons and I used to look forward to updates by my favorite authors, but the new policy that has been placed has honestly made me stop loving webtoons. Each person has their own type of comic they chose to read and ever since the new policy, I and many friends have lost interest in reading webtoons at all...even though it hurts me to say all this it's true.","2031":"I love WEBTOON I go to it when ever I get the chance, but because of their new policy (policy saying you can\u2019t post any mature content even if it\u2019s censored) most of the  discover comics I read doesn\u2019t have the have the right flow anymore . The people making the comics suffered too because without it the story doesn\u2019t work well. I just wish they take down the policy because it\u2019s affecting the creators ability to create a story they love because there changing the procedures they\u2019ve already got used to. \nThank you","2032":"Love the app it\u2019s wonderful free comics it\u2019s amazing but I wish they allowed stuff for mature audiences as well like if they were certain age it unlocks adult comics, maybe gore or NSFW images otherwise it\u2019s a amazing app. I feel the app would increase its readers and downloads drastically higher than ever before if they added what was said above.","2033":"I love this app... it\u2019s so addicting, I told one of my friends at school about it we became webtoon nerds. I love it since there no pop up adds like most games. It\u2019s also free and You don\u2019t need to pay or wait to read more chapters like most apps. The story\u2019s are amazing... I SWEAR... I straight up read a story (webtoon) for    5 hours nonstop","2034":"Ok so I love this app but the only thing is that I don\u2019t want to buy coins and I don\u2019t want to wait a while to read a web toon. So can think about having people not buy coins and as soon as the new story comes out we can read it please think about it!\u2764\ufe0f","2035":"One thing I can not stand is how most apps only give you very little reading time. This app has not limited my reading since I\u2019ve joined. \n\nEvery comic is unique and there\u2019s quite a few that I\u2019m hooked on. \n\nGreat app for reading! Definitely recommend \ud83e\udd70","2036":"This app if a holy grail! The story\u2019s on here have great development and emotion sometimes I feel like I am in the book! Though we have to wait a bit until the next chapter the wait is usually worth it. Great and a suggest you get this if your into this kind of stuff","2037":"This was my first ever web toon app, and I gotta be honest, I\u2019ve been addicted to the comics on here for the past 5ish years now. There\u2019s a nearly endless pool of comics from every single genre possible. This and the Tapas app are both tied for #1 in my book as being fantastic in their own ways!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70","2038":"While, yes, I am disappointed they\u2019ve locked completed Webtoons behind a million micro transactions, my biggest issue with this app is its CRAZY battery drainage.\n\nEx: For the 12 mins I actively spent in WEBTOON today, it spent another 2 hr 35 min continuing to drain my battery. My phone is now constantly hot to the touch. I shouldn\u2019t be down to 26% 4 hours after I pull it off its charger. This is ridiculous, especially with no option to turn off background app refresh. I suspect there\u2019s more to this app than just comics.","2039":"Been a reader for several years and I totally regret updating this app. No way of reading old episodes of Cheese in the Trap without a Daily Pass? Like how dumb can this corporation be during the time of international crisis, make it harder for people to read comics? Come up with a better idea. Maybe make the 1  Daily Pass use an actual purchase of the episode, or make each episode purchasable if you REALLY WANT money. Greed ruins many apps, Webtoons is on its way out.","2040":"So basically I really like using this app but like when u get far into a comic u would have to either use coins which I brought with real money or wait like half a week to unlock the next episode. I think they should change this and make us watch ads or some instead","2041":"When I first got this app, I loved it. But then WEBTOON got updated and now when ever I want to read something, the screen becomes gray and I cannot go back so I have to exit and go back into the app but still doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know why this is happening, and I hope that other people aren\u2019t experiencing this too.","2042":"I really enjoy Webtoon however I think there\u2019s been a bug. The app logged out my account so I tried to log back in. A message said that my email isn\u2019t registered with Webtoon. I thought that maybe my keychain saved it incorrectly so I then manually inputed my log in, but still an error popped up. I then attempted to make a new account which said that I have already registered with Webtoon. This is ridiculous, please fix this issue.","2043":"I first started using WEBTOON about a year ago and I had no complaints at the time, but now I can\u2019t read more than two stories without having to watch an ad to move on. It takes up too much time and I never get to end up actually reading the full story, and the ads repeat to it makes the experience overall annoying,","2044":"I bought coins for fast passes that no longer show up. The app was having issues so I deleted and reinstalled it but lost everything. It doesn\u2019t show any history of payments and it shows no subscriptions I had, not to mention the fast pass chapters I bought with coins I no longer have access to. It wants me to pay for those again. So very disappointed, was very in love with this app and many series on it prior to my account being \u201cwiped\u201d it seems.","2045":"I love this app so much, I\u2019ve been using it since 2017, but recently it\u2019s been getting extremely buggy. It takes minutes to load the app itself, and then even more time to get to my daily updated Webtoons I\u2019m subscribed to. When I try to click on the Webtoon, it takes at least 10 tries for it to actually open up, but then it just turns blank. I really hope this is fixed because I would love to continue using this app. Thank you!","2046":"The daily pass is really inconvinent for us readers who hav used the app forever, i started using the app in 2015 and i like re-reading some great webtoons but the daily pass had made it inconvinent. I have cancer and readng webtoons made me go through it easier:). Pls remove the daily pass feature.","2047":"THIS APP IS AMAZING ! But, fads pass is not cool.  for example I read True Beauty and once and I was hooked on the story and when I wanted to go to the next episode it was on fast pass and I could not read it! I HAD TO WAIT 3 WHOLE DAYS+THE ORHER 27 DAYS FOR TGE NEXT EPISODES! Some ppl are patrons for a writer and in the 1st place they are already reading the comic ! I will give them 5 stars if they take away fast pass. \n\n-A loyal Webtoon reader","2048":"I hate reading and would not read for more than 15 minutes and then I got this app and now I could latterly read for hours on end when you are reading WEBTOON it is like you are there in the world, one time my friend referred to one of the people as herself 10\/10 would recommend","2049":"You read stories from astonishing writers! They have stories from all different ranges. Horror to Romance, I love it so much. And the best part is all the stories are free. You can become a patron and donate money to the writer or open the next weeks story on that comic. The app is super organized and easy to navigate. Love this app!!!","2050":"I really love this app I use it all the time but on this tower of god event I did it but I didn\u2019t get my 5 coins I don\u2019t have any other complaints I would just like my 5 coins please help I read all 100 episodes in 3 days please help I lost a lot of sleep on this","2051":"I absolutely love this app, there are so many stories out there in this app that get my heart flowing with excitement and how the WEBTOONs sometimes get a Kdrama, like, \u2018Cheese in The Trap\u2019 or \u2018love alarm.\u2019 \nmany of these stories are so cute and the art styles are amazing. I like the genres and ext that this adds on too. the only thing I don\u2019t like is the cliffhangers. haha.","2052":"You should add more things like writing stuff for people who aren\u2019t good drawer because I want to implement my book from webnovel and or you could make a 2nd app that allows you to be able to make premodern comic type characters from stuff like comic creators website","2053":"You know I get the patreon part but what happened to when the app was free, I miss binging episode after episode. I could get lost in a world of imagination but now?... now, I have to pay to see the latest episode or to even read a episode of a complete series that I had already watched. It\u2019s sad to think everything is about money now. Sorry but I think that just brings down the overall rating of this amazing but priced app.","2054":"I\u2019ve had this app and loved it for 5 to 6 years now and it\u2019s been one of my favorite apps by far than anything else in the AppStore. Also, when fast pass was introduced, I liked the idea of buying coins to skip the wait on your favorites novel. BUT. But now we need a daily pass for COMPLETED webtoons\/novels? Im not gonna balance money on future and past webtoons. I mean, if that money goes towards the authors of webtoons and novels, you need to say so. If not people are gonna think wrongly and think take you as a money hungry app.","2055":"It would be better if we could watch adds to get the coins. I know you guys want the money, but it would be better watching adds then crying for not not being able to read a book. It really breaks my heart not being able to finish a book. You just lost a person that downloaded this app. Hope you guys soon do this, if not, nice meeting you guys.","2056":"Amazing app love it (thus the five stars) but whenever I open the app, nothing loads in. The titles of the actual comics and stuff will load in but the frames or the thumbnails will not. So I can\u2019t read these stories. Overall amazing app but I would prefer if you fixed this","2057":"I can\u2019t tell you how much I love this app but the only thing is when you login on a new device it doesn\u2019t remember what page you\u2019re on so I recommend that you like the every page you already read I would also recommend to read bastard if you love thriller.","2058":"I love this app , I\u2019ve read a great majority of the comics and love finding new ones to read . BUT what I don\u2019t like is when I\u2019m in the middle of reading a comic and all of a sudden it just disappears ! Literally trying to load next chapter and then it says \u201cerror chapters been deleted\u201d I go to look for the comic again and it\u2019s completely GONE ! It was even taken off of my favorites ... a bit upsetting since I didn\u2019t get to finish it and was looking forward to how interesting it was getting ... so disappointing","2059":"I would give 5 stars if not for 2 things:\n- the censorship. I understand that there are laws in S. Korea (etc) preventing them from showing certain things, but there should be a way to confirm your age on the app like there are with most Manga apps to allow us access to restricted content.\n\n- the inconsistency when changing between devices. I am logged in on both my iPad and iPhone (on the same account obviously) and my bookmarks are never the same between both devices. In other manga apps, if I end on ch 2, I will start on chapter 2 on either device, not only on the one I was using at the time.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s a great app and I\u2019m grateful it\u2019s free with the opportunity to donate to authors!","2060":"I love, and I mean absolutely love Webtoons. It\u2019s amazing. The only thing I wish was different was that when you open a story on one device, your progress doesn\u2019t move to another device. (Example: if I open it on my iPad and then I go to look on my phone, it doesn\u2019t show anything and I have to figure out what chapter I was on.)","2061":"I really love Webtoon because the layout is clean and easy to understand, plus has lots of webtoons to read on it for completely free! Every morning when I wake up this is the first app I check. But then they created this new policy that has affected many webtoon artists. It was about mature content, and I believe they should make an account system that uses the age of its users to decide which webtoons they can and cannot read instead of this policy.","2062":"I love this app, I use it almost everyday to read up on fantastic characters. They always try and throw in new stories from up and coming authors\/illustrators and it's very refreshing to see so many different styles! Nothing to complain about here","2063":"I have so many favorite comics on the app! I love participating in the events that give out free coins because I can discover new comics, but I always get server error messages that tell me to try again later and I end up being cheated of my free coins! Please fix this! I completed my end of the deal!","2064":"I love webtoon ,it\u2019s the best but it takes for ever to get the episodes available I spend every day checking my phone too see if the episode is available and can you make sure you can bye the coins by using ads too unlock them please","2065":"Webtoon is really amazing, there are some really talented and amazing stories and artists and it takes you away from reality, it\u2019s so entertaining and it keep you excited for the following weeks if your bored in quarantine. I really like it and I think you should try it too!","2066":"Webtoon used to be so much better the pass thing is dumb I miss reading freely as much at I wanted I purposely didn\u2019t read it my favorites for a while to later on just read it all in like a few weeks without waiting for the next episode but with the pass it makes you wait regardless it\u2019s stupid I really hate it it was better back then now idk so much..","2067":"Love it amazing app really is I recommend but what is daily whatever it is? Why do I have to pay for these stories I want to finish the story\u2019s because they are amazing but I can\u2019t I have to pay and I don\u2019t want to if I can\u2019t finish these stories im deleting this app and leaving a bad review telling my friends not to get it just please let me finish the stories with no money!!!!","2068":"Uhh so idk of this is just me or if this is everyone but when I go into the app, I can\u2019t read anything. It doesn\u2019t show me what I\u2019m subscribed to, nor does it show the episodes. It could just be my crappy internet, but it could also be an issue for everyone. Idk. Just wanted to see if this was happening to anyone else :\\","2069":"I\u2019m absolutely in love with Webtoon, I love so many of the stories and illustrations, I wish it wasn\u2019t such a long wait for the next episode but I can respect it lol, I\u2019ve really been on an emotional roller coaster with so many stories but I still enjoy them no matter what.. We toon honestly changed my life. \ud83e\udd17","2070":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, this app is amazing! But I don\u2019t like the fact that I have to wait a certain amount of days until I am allowed to read the next chapter. I have to wait 35 days to read one of the chapters. By then I will have to re read the entire WEBTOON before I can keep going, then I will have to wait again.","2071":"Please don\u2019t be deleting there comics we all love it and support it, and i been asking if y\u2019all can add more bl comics but for some reason they get taken down and I don\u2019t want that to happened. I rlly enjoyed reading bl comics it makes me excited but if there no bl comics how am i going to be happy.","2072":"I love WEBTOON to death, but I really need some sort of green check mark next to the notification bells letting me know that I\u2019ve finished reading everything in the comic. Or maybe make it an optional thing. But it would be nice to have some sort of indicator for comics that I have already finished or am up to date with reading.","2073":"I\u2019ve used the app for a really long time and I love reading the comics people post. But just today, I\u2019ve noticed my app keeps crashing and I\u2019m not sure why. I\u2019ve tried deleting and downloading the app again, but it still crashes.","2074":"I opened my app and was logged out of my account. I try signing back in but my email isn\u2019t working. Can somebody please explain to me what the hell happened, because i love this is one of my most favorite app. It\u2019d be a shame if i had to let it go.","2075":"i love this app so much but my only complaint is the ads recently have not been playing i tried resetting the advertising identifier in my privacy settings but the ads still don\u2019t load please fix this","2076":"I have notifications on yet last week and this week I didn\u2019t get the notification for the coin wheel. Got plenty of other notifications but none for that. And I was checking right at 4pm PDT up to like an hour later. It never sent. Please fix this and fix the customer service thing.","2077":"I love this app it\u2019s the best thing in my life right now....but for the past couple of weeks it won\u2019t connect to my WiFi or my data plan. I\u2019m missing all of the updates and it doesn\u2019t work anymore AND this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened! It\u2019s just getting annoying now","2078":"I love this app but it make u pay a lot to and if u don\u2019t pay u have to wait a long time they should cut it donw a bit and they should post Monday and Sunday it would be more helpful and on ghost who ever made it omg it is the best thing I ever read. It make u keep going and when it stop u you get mad","2079":"I\u2019m giving it 5 stars because I really like it and it functions really well. It\u2019s just that sometimes there\u2019s a bug with the ads in which a loading sign appears and continuously redirects me to the ad page on safari.","2080":"Whenever I look at a webtoon on my subscribed list, I always have to scroll down again when I exit the webtoon. So if I\u2019m trying to looking at a webtoon and I exit the page, I have to scroll all the way back down in order to get to it. The issue is kind of hard to describe so my explanation might not make sense.","2081":"The app itself is good though it needs to be updated soon as I\u2019m having some trouble with comics not loading and the app just turns off by itself. It\u2019s starting to happen with more comics now and it\u2019s getting annoying please fix it soon WEBTOON.","2082":"I loved the story. And for the first 26 episodes it just let me keep reading but I knew at some point it would make me wait to read more. I didn\u2019t expect however, 6 days to be the wait time. The only way to keep reading would be spending real money to get coins. And you don\u2019t even get that much. If it was one day it wouldn\u2019t be that bad but I\u2019m not waiting 6 days every time I want to read one chapter. Even if it would let me read 26 more six days is just way too much.","2083":"So I live in a country that doesn\u2019t really have unlimited Internet everywhere so I will I download my WEBTOON\u2019s every day before I read them.  And now I\u2019m find it when you don\u2019t have Internet at sometimes struggles to open the downloaded webtoons and actually if I like close the app and reopen it it loses the bookmark so off-line mode isn\u2019t really off-line","2084":"First of all, i love this app and the contents, but i would like a mode where you don\u2019t have to scroll down, but have a thing like a \u201cpage mode\u201d, where you can swipe to see the next page. The scrolling down made my eyes hurt in less than 5 minutes of reading.","2085":"I\u2019ve always LOVED WEBTOON.... I could handle the changes of not letting some art show... but now charging to view the stories??!! Now your literally tapas!!!! I read WEBTOONs and not tapas for I didn\u2019t have to pay, which so many people can\u2019t do!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE IDEA! I hope authors leave and go to another app! Now it\u2019s the EXACT same as Tapas! Go to tapas- more artists, better up dates, more options, better layout and if their going to charge- go to what\u2019s better!!!","2086":"I have been using WEBTOON for about a year and I love all of these comics. I read them almost everyday, but once I got inspired enough to write my own comics I found that I couldn\u2019t create(publish) any because I was using a mobile devise. I am very upset about this, and I hope that this will change in the next update.","2087":"I clicked on a daily pass story to read it and it didn\u2019t allow me to because it said I was registered on another device when the only device I registered on was my phone. Now I can\u2019t read any of the daily pass stories. Please fix this.","2088":"I love webtoon. I really do, it\u2019s just for the fact that there\u2019s a new policy. Many of my favorite creators had to take down some of their episodes and others had to take down their whole comic. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right because isn\u2019t webtoon supposed to be a place where you can show your work, where you can make people happy with your stories. You can\u2019t always do that with this new policy. It\u2019s honestly quite annoying and surprisingly rude. I hope you change this soon.","2089":"I love WEBTOON but they have been putting a policy on my favorite webtoons. All of the webtoons that have were you have to be 18 and older or have adult that lets you read it,but many people have been reading them just to put bad reviews, and now they are taking many of them down. Can you please put webtoon back to the way it was for all of the readers and Authors  \nso we can all enjoy webtoon again.","2090":"WEBTOON was my all time favorite app and I was actually considering deleting all of my other ones \ud83d\ude02 However because of this new policy, even much more kid friendly webtoons are being forced to make what seem like unnecessary changes to their content. This not only makes WEBTOON much less enjoyable for reader but also authors (Even the ones who don\u2019t voice their concerns about it) I love this app I feel like this new policy is just taking away from it.\ud83d\ude22","2091":"I love webtoon!!! It has MANY amazing comics that\u2019s are so entertaining! My only problem is with the new policy....it\u2019s causing many of my favorite authors to stop posting on webtoon \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc94. Please change the policy back to what it was before! Regardless of age, people know what \u201cmature content\u201d means so they shouldn\u2019t complain about it. Authors spend SO MUCH of their time and even money to make their comics. They should be free to add whatever they want in them...if people don\u2019t like that, they don\u2019t have to read that author\u2019s comics \ud83d\ude44....Just saying","2092":"I love to read so I\u2019m always looking for apps with looks but most are boring or end poorly but with WEBTOON the fun,suspense, an adventure never seems to fail me I love this app it\u2019s the best thing I have ever downloaded!!!!! I like seeing som photos to get action in a story I mean who doesn\u2019t an I like anime an cute drawings this app has it all!\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","2093":"This is the best comic app that i've ever downloaded!! The artist and authors are amazing AND it has awesome BL. Only thing that would make the app better is if you didn't have a discover comic sub limit because when i find a really good comic i have to delete a great comic just to sub to the newer comic. All and all 5 stars \ud83d\ude0a","2094":"I love reading webtoons and this app is amazing. It has very high quality ones, with talented authors that take very much in consideration what fans think. It is very easy to explore the app and find what types and genres you like the most. I love this app and highly recommend it to everyone.","2095":"This app is amazing! There is so many comics that I enjoy on here! Translations and comments and much, much more. This app makes artis\u2019 dreams come true by putting it on a simple app! I love WEBTOON and I want to see it grow more! And you should really go check out a comic called, Lumine. It\u2019s wonderful in every single way! I love you WEBTOON!","2096":"This app is insane! I was worried it was going to be bland and boring with a good read here and there but I've barley been able to put my stupid phone down. Blazed through UnOrdinary, The gamer, phantom paradise, and currently readying nano list. All amazing reads recommend this app 100% god tier level stuff thank you whoever created!","2097":"I am a webtoons addict but it\u2019s an addiction that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone.\nIf you were to download this application I absolutely guarantee you will love it because there or so many genres to choose from so many art styles and so many character to fall heads over heals in love with","2098":"So I\u2019ve used WEBTOON for a long time now and recently I switched phones, but when I downloaded WEBTOON again I noticed that, while the stories I\u2019ve subscribed to was saved, the actual data, that tells if you\u2019ve read that episode or not, is completely gone. So now I don\u2019t know where I am in the story. :\/","2099":"Love this app in every way! Safe and fun stories to read and it\u2019s great! Only minor problem is that the app crashes when you get to the end of an episode... only started happening in the last 3 weeks or so, so definitely not permanent  (I hope)","2100":"I think it is stupid that creators are put on hiatus Specially my favorite Emma krogell The maker of lumineI love the series and I would write this app five stars if they were to put her off hiatus I love this app I love that you can download it for free it\u2019s just I want the series 2 to my story so if you do that in the next year I will rate you five stars.\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude16","2101":"I love webtoon because of the stories that it has, I\u2019m in love with them so a 5 star, I\u2019m not sure with the bad stuff or ykyk since I don\u2019t use it much but on my phone it always crashes me after reading some episodes which is annoying mostly when it gets on the good part but overall I love it :]","2102":"Hi thx for reading this well I..I... just love this my favorite story is lookism sooo read it and many other This app is making me want to draw more and become what is this app made for sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo get it now or that would be the biggest mistake you ever did in your life sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo GET IT NOWWWW","2103":"I love this app it makes my life very exciting when i get done reading a comic i have to remind my self that im in real like its so engaging and theres alot of different categories to choose from so there something for everyone one","2104":"Lately there\u2019s been screen blocking white pop up ads. They have no option to close and often pop up when I\u2019m trying to read a chapter, making it impossible to finish reading without having to entirely close the app. Rating 3 stars until this is fixed.","2105":"I started reading on there website first but when I found out that you had a app I got excited. This app is the best and doesn\u2019t have any problems. I\u2019m not a person who reads a lot of books but this makes it now intresting.","2106":"I first picked it up because I saw ads everywhere, I started reading then came across Lore Olympus and I fell in love! It\u2019s the best love story you could ever want! I\u2019ve cosplayed, shared, and reread the comic. I like the mechanics of WEBTOON, it\u2019s pretty easy to operate on. I also like how they remember what episode you were in so you don\u2019t lose track! Best app ever!","2107":"This is such a great spot to read talent! My only sadness is I wish the app connected to multiple devices. When I read on my phone it doesn\u2019t mark read if I\u2019m on my iPad or computer even though it\u2019s the same account. That\u2019s my only wish so I remember where I am at!","2108":"Just why, why FAST PAS COINS, you should make challenges to get coins if ur that desperate for cash, but seriously! Where\u2019s the fun in buying coins just for one fast pass! There should be like a membership type of thing! I\u2019m so close to deleting WEBTOON just because I can\u2019t read my daily dose of UnORDINARY!!!!! I\u2019m mad, just pls get rid of it or at least make some challenges to EARN coins instead of buying them for us Poor PEOPLE! REEEEEEEE","2109":"I love WEBTOON! It is a great way to read when normal reading gets boring. The only problem I have with it is that when using WEBTOON on a computer if you watch an episode of something, it doesn\u2019t save over to your mobile account. Other than that, I love it.","2110":"It may have found u have to buy with money so u don\u2019t have to wait for next episode but other than that it\u2019s the best u should start on pretty something it\u2019s the best it has drama, love, mystery and adds a lesson at the end so good u should downlaod this app and start on the story that was on the advertisement","2111":"Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love the content and the fact that is free. I really do. And I would gladly support the authors any way I could. But I\u2019m giving it two stars because of how glitchy this app is. Scrolling on a WEBTOON is a nightmare. The app freezes on several screen and it takes a while to work again. Even after I quit the app my phone slows down for a couple minutes. This only happens with this app.","2112":"Tried to finish Lumine but webtoon wants me to buy coins to read the rest or.. I wait 2 days each to finish the episodes...I mean litterly all of reading apps have this thing where you have to buy some type of stuff to read the rest..it\u2019s not nessacary i mean I know you want money but...why do that? You could add something to earn coins instead..instead of buying then ONLY..not fair webtoon..","2113":"I\u2019m trying to sign in to WEBTOON, it absolutely won\u2019t work, I\u2019ve tried it many times and I\u2019m not getting any where. I loved in and it kicked me out, I tried signing up and it would not sign in\n(I had the wrong password even tho I knows it was the right one) I got the verification email and it told me I was fine but it still wasn\u2019t working. Please fix it, it\u2019s still a good app tho","2114":"I really love this app. When I first started playing I was like..wait..you don\u2019t need like tickets to keep reading? Because most story apps I have use tickets. But no tickets here. The stories are so great and wonderful, with wonderful authors. What else is there to say? 5 stars no question \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f","2115":"Before downloading this app I though that I would delete it after a few days but that isn\u2019t the case, ever since then I\u2019ve been hooked on their great series that contain beautiful artwork! Some recommendations are : Unordinary, My Dear Cold Blooded King, Freaking Romance, Tower of God, God of high school, and many more! Just know it\u2019s a great app!","2116":"I am here to thank the creators and contributors to this app. It has brought me so much happiness and makes me feel like i am using my phone in a healthy way rather than the horrible dark holes one may fall into with the usage of social media. thank you thank you artists, lovers, and creators alike!!!","2117":"There\u2019s an ad display at the END of each episode of the comic (aka basically invisible). ZERO ad pop-ups!! And some of the stories on here are incredible! You may not be able to put your phone down if you download this, just a warning. ;)","2118":"I absolutely love Webtoons. I read it every day. My one issue is that every time the app updates it won\u2019t open on my phone for about a day. After that it\u2019s fine but it\u2019s always that first day every time t updates and I can\u2019t figure out why.","2119":"Bruh I tried to download this other comic app and I was reading a hella good comic and after only two episodes it wanted me to pay for \u201ctokens\u201d. I immediately deleted it and downloaded webtoons which probably has BETTER stories for FREE. Other apps pay attention \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24","2120":"I read I mostly for shen but I\u2019d love it if they added Hop Dude by Dave Mercier (the author of Mercworks) and I\u2019d spend much much more time using it! I\u2019ve had issues in the past with it freezing up on me and you should always make sure to download a comic before you read it (its easier to read that way). Overall great app I just wish they had Hop Dude.","2121":"Can u guys fix the the hearting glitch thing. Every time I click on it and leave the chapters it doesn\u2019t show up. Then I have to quickly go otherwise later it will erase it completely. Its greatly annoying at this point. Ever since a update or two ago it\u2019s been happening and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. OTHERWISE, it\u2019s a great app for  reading webcomic with interesting plot lines.","2122":"I personally LOVE this app and all the new artists and stories I can discover! However, I\u2019ve noticed an issue running the app recently, specifically when trying to read the new webcomic by Stan Lee. I don\u2019t think the apps processors can handle the normal stationary comic, sound, and animated panels at the same time. Ifs this gets fixed, then this app will be perfect.","2123":"This is an awesome app with amazing stories and artists, but our accounts and stories online should sync with our accounts and stories on the app. It\u2019s annoying having to search where I am in a comic when I was reading it on my phone and transfer to my laptop cause i usually forget.","2124":"I love webtoon but the new policy is forcing a lot of the artists\/authors to change their stories. Webtoon will be less enjoyable without those webtoons that I love so dearly. The new policy is unnecessary. I have been using different apps to read the same stories I have started on webtoon. If this keeps up I might to leave webtoon entirely, because all of the great webtoon creators have been forced to chance their story or start to upload on different apps that expect their storylines.","2125":"I have been following Webtoon for a while now and have loved that they allowed so much freedom and creativity to be featured. And then came the new zero NSFW policy. This is seriously going to force so many artists to ruin the wonderful stories they have worked so hard on and most of my favorites will be removed. I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll use the app if the policy isn\u2019t lifted.","2126":"Okay webtoon is easily the best comic app you can ask for. Like you can read comic with out that stupid coin stuff, and create your own comics. There are really great comics and many of them to choose from. I suggest this app if you like comics. You can also download comic and read them offline. It\u2019s great!","2127":"I loved webtoon up until this new update. A lot of my favorite web comics are no longer going on because of this. I feel like there should be away to fix this for the people 18+ for the more mature content or NSFW content. It\u2019s not really fair for those artists who work hard for their content to be taken down when they put warnings and censor stuff when needed. I honestly probably won\u2019t be on the app much after this. Kinda disappointed.","2128":"I really love this app, I can read all kinds of comics for free but the new policy has changed some of my favorites. The creators can\u2019t express their webtoons the way they want to anymore, and some had to stop their comics, so please change the policy. You don\u2019t exactly have to erase it completely but please change it so that the creators won\u2019t have to either change their comic, or delete it.","2129":"I use this app everyday; pretty much all day long. It's easy to use, and I think it helps creators get their toons put out in the open. Proud of you Webtoon. All the endless good, weird, sappy and unusual stuff to read all the time. Anytime. A large collection of stories to keep us entertained\/interested.","2130":"This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite apps. The creative storytelling, the user interface is all very superb. The only complaint is that, I can\u2019t open the app, even though my iPhone 5s is compatible with it. I\u2019ve tried everything with it, nothing worked. I\u2019m guessing this is a big, please fix!","2131":"Don't get me wrong. I love this app. It gives me plenty of comics to read. After the last update though, the app keeps crashing. It used to show the WebToon logo to load and then show me my display. However, it now shows the logo and immediately crashes. Please fix this quickly.","2132":"This new updated version is prompting a message saying there is another device logged on my account, when I only have one device added on my account. This issue is not allowing me to read any episode of any WEBTOON. \nDevelopers, please check possible bug.","2133":"I was kicked out so I logged back in and when I did I lost all my coins and comics I was subscribed to. I tried getting into contact with consumer service but all I got was a confirmation email a few days ago saying they\u2019d get in touch in 24 hours, which obviously never happened. It\u2019s really disappointing since I really do love the comics, but now I\u2019m not sure that I can ever trust buying coins again.","2134":"The app is great it\u2019s just that the websites when you comment people send you websites that are not for kids or teens these are adult websites and I don\u2019t think that they should be on WEBTOON so please block all these people off of WEBTOON because this is not safe but overall the app is amazing it\u2019s just the website that people are commenting so please fix this","2135":"Okay so maybe WEBTOON was my addiction \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02 My favorite story was definitely \u201cSinner\u201d or \u201cOur Omega Leadernim\u201d Those were my favorites and even though I haven\u2019t used this in a while I love the stories on here! Most inappropriate stuff gets removed or sent to Tapas. So it\u2019s a good app for atleast 12+. Definitely recommend this!","2136":"I love reading webtoons but earlier when I tried to hop on webtoon it logged me out. No big deal right? When I log back in it removed all my free coins and unlocked fast pass episodes and a few of my series. I tried going to the help center but it kept throwing me out and the help center is confusing and needs way too much info. Someone plz help me.","2137":"This application is garbage, after I\u2019ve spent money on this app multiple times, I\u2019ve now lost all coins, unlocked pages, and my account acts like I just created it. I didn\u2019t even get to spend the coins I just bought, and it tells me I\u2019ve never purchased anything on this app, while my bank account says otherwise.\n\nThis has happened to multiple people and they never refund your money or give you your missing content.","2138":"I really love this app, but I just updated it and now it keeps crashing and won\u2019t open. It\u2019s not my phone because all of my other apps are running fine. I hope this bug gets fixed quickly bc I would like to read my favorite Webtoons!","2139":"Hi, I\u2019ve actually been reading WEBTOON for years now and it\u2019s better than ever except the daily pass thingy. I mean there\u2019s nothing wrong in the authors getting credit I get it. But plz do consider those of us who are really stressed with this whole quarantined situation and wanna have some relaxation to read but have no money to spend due to bills. I do hope we can have a compromise to that","2140":"I absolutely love Webtoon and the stories on there but paying coins to read completed stories is just greedy. Not everyone can afford it and plus it makes the author lose a lot of their readers. You already make a lot of money off of fast passes, so please take it off.","2141":"It\u2019s a really good app full of great stories the only problem is the timer is messed up, on most stories it says that the next episode is unlocked after a certain amount of time but it said \u201cunlocked in 2 days\u201d for 2 weeks straight. I just think you should look into it","2142":"When I first got the app when I wanted to download a webtoon it let me go back to the page and continue to read webtoon a while the other one was downloading it is still a really good app that is about the only problem with it there is a lot of great stories like unOrdinary lumine castle swimmer true beauty and many more","2143":"I\u2019ve been looking for an app I can read comics like this on, I\u2019ve downloaded about 7 different apps looking for this and this is awesome. Good stories, no NSFW, very few ads, easy to navigate, great support, no asking for money or reviews, option to read ahead, I just love it.","2144":"When I try to buy more coins it freezes up and spins forever and then will say something along the lines about my connection which fair there was a snowstorm happening but now it\u2019s the next day and it\u2019s a clear as can be and the circle will just spin no connection notification just spinning","2145":"ITS NOT LETING ME OPEN THE APP this is my favorite app ever and it\u2019s not working I have like so many stories to finish And it decide not to work May 6,2020 it\u2019s been working perfectly fine I\u2019ve never had an issue with that I tried deleting it and downloading it back and it\u2019s still not working please help!!!??","2146":"Compared to other comic\/ reading apps I most definitely recommend this one. Not only does it has multiple genres, it is also very easy to manage & find what you are looking for. & it doesn\u2019t scam you for your money like other apps.","2147":"Webtoon is my new favorite!! You can read comics for free and no glitches happen on my device! It\u2019ll ask you what way you like the people to be drawn and find stories that style. It\u2019ll also ask you what type of books you like also. Awesome app!","2148":"Webtoon used to be my go to for my comic reading but ever since this daily pass crap there is almost no point in trying any more. Because you have to wait a week for a new chapter to come out ,and buy the first 3, until the book is finished then you would think. Ok since it\u2019s all out I can reread it really easy nope you can only read 2 chapters a day. I already had to wait years for some books to finish just so I can be told F-you you can wait 4 mouths to reread a book.","2149":"This app used to be my go to for WEBTOON but lately it hasn\u2019t been. Always says internet connection is not working, but my phone works and half the time I\u2019m connected to wifi. So idk what the problem is, also tried deleting app and redownloading that didn\u2019t help at all. I hope this gets fixed soon!!","2150":"this app is amazing, there\u2019s only one thing i\u2019d change. There should be a dark mode. Everything i have is put on dark mode since i get headaches and read at night to fall asleep. The bright white is kind of an eye strain. but other than that, it\u2019s perfect!","2151":"I use this app everyday, literally but a new log in challenge started and it\u2019s now restarted on me 3 times!!!! I loose all my log in progress and sometimes the prompt for you to log your progress doesn\u2019t show up. And then when you try to contact the developers there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to contact them just Q&A of frequently asked questions. I post this in hopes someone will reach out to me to fix this but I feel as if I\u2019m going to be sorely disappointed","2152":"I adore this app, as it has tons of comics just a few taps away. But I would like to become a creator, and I only have my IPad available to me for drawing. So I would suggest that you allow mobile users the ability to update. Just a suggestion!","2153":"After I updated the app with the supposed minor improvements, I can\u2019t actually read anything. Opening the app, it will tell me no WiFi, despite me knowing that I have WiFi on my phone. I go to my list, and the Weebtoons show up, but their position isn\u2019t updated and when I try to open one to read it the app refuses, telling me again that I don\u2019t have an internet connection. Please, for my favorite creators sake, FIX IT.","2154":"The new daily pass system is terrible went back to re read orange marmalade and I would only be able to read a few chapters at a time before they time out due to this system do not like at all wish you could keep you daily pass chapters for a lot longer so you can read the whole comic in one sitting like I like to do. Although the better option would be to scrap the daily pass system altogether.","2155":"Phenomenal. It\u2019s free, the only time I pay is if I want early access to some stuff. There are amazing stories on here with beautiful artwork and I have a different read for every day of the week. Honestly it\u2019s great having something to always look forward to.","2156":"I love this app! Every time my phone notifies me that there\u2019s an update I get so excited to read another episode! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves great stories, have a specific genre? No problem, they have filters and a story that you will like!","2157":"I\u2019ve had this installed for a while and it\u2019s been fantastic so far. The only complaint is something that can\u2019t even be controlled by the app itself. Now that there are fast passes, the comments aren\u2019t as focused on the specific webtoons and moreso on the fast pass.","2158":"I like to take long brakes on it so I can come back with a lot of updated stories. I only wish you could earn coins instead of buying them. So many options and free to use. I would recommend this to all my friends. You should try it!","2159":"I hate WEBTOON. It\u2019s got so many good stories and artists and design and I\u2019m addicted. Like as addicted as a drug addict is to meth. But the episodes only come out like once a week! I\u2019m dying over here! I need more! I would 10\/10 recommend this app, so long as you can deal with the wait for each new episode","2160":"So I\u2019ve been greatly enjoying it for some time. I love seeing all the work of these artists. Although the new update is making my app crash a lot. I haven\u2019t been able to read for very long. It will freeze and do nothing until I close the app. It would be 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for this issue.","2161":"I\u2019ve had the app for a while and it\u2019s always worked well, but now that it\u2019s updated today, it won\u2019t open at all and it keeps crashing. I got notifications of webtoons that have updated but I\u2019m sad that I can\u2019t read them","2162":"After a few days of having it, whenever I would click on a webtoon to read it would load for HOURS!! And I thought \"maybe I just need to update it\" but I haven't updated it in so long and it never said you needed to! I can't even read any of my favorite shows now! It used to be fantastic so I would've given it a 5 but it doesn't even work so a 3","2163":"I\u2019ve had Webtoon for a long time now but lately I\u2019ve been having some issues. It started the other day when I went to go read a comic. The whole thing froze and I sat there for 10 minutes thinking it would unfreeze eventually but it didn\u2019t. Now I can barely open the app and it freezes on the home page. Please fix this.","2164":"I\u2019ve been using this app for a while and have always love being able to view the work of the creators that share here. The new policy has resulted in many of my favorite WEBTOONs being discontinued. I have heard quite a few of my coworkers and friends mentioning that they deleted the app for this reason. Please fix this. Is ad revenue really worth all the app deletions. ~Thank you~","2165":"This app is absolutely amazing. I love it, I\u2019m on it pretty much every single day. All the comics I read keep me entertained and happy. But of course, I do like to read a bit of nsfw comics, and those I really like too. But the new policy pretty much ruined it for me. I can\u2019t enjoy certain comics anymore. The app is still amazing, but they took away one thing that I like to enjoy. So I don\u2019t like that at all.","2166":"I really loved Webtoon because you got to read mature content manga for free, even if it had to be censored. but now with their new policy it\u2019s affected many creators content and have made them either quit doing Webtoon or change their Webtoon story line. This is very upsetting because I won\u2019t be able to read my favorite Webtoons anymore because either the creator decided to quit or they had to change the storyline, which is not very idle. Please switch back to your old policy Webtoon.","2167":"I LOVE this app it is so fun to pass time getting lost in the story but once in a wile it will glitch and on the episodes that u have to wait to get a free pass won\u2019t let u read them after the first time but it happens very rarely but it is kind of frustrating but 9-10% do recommend to anyone who loves comics and anime.","2168":"I have used this app so many times, and I love the variety of different webtoons for everyone. I really suggest this app, and the creators of these stories are so creative. If I had to pick a few to suggest to others I would say Bastard, Siren\u2019s Lament\u2764\ufe0f,UnOrdinary, Lookism, and Let\u2019s Play, but there are so much more that I love.","2169":"I bought coins and then the app updated, all my coins were gone and I got unsubbed from all my stories. The daily pass thing is absolutely ridiculous, I\u2019d rather pay for a membership instead of pay for individual chapters on already completed stories AND there\u2019s a timer on top of it??? Y\u2019all are seriously shady for that and going to lose so many people who used to love this app.","2170":"This is actually a very new thing that just started. You go on the info page of a story and it doesn\u2019t show all the episodes. It\u2019s just blank. For one of my fav stories I forgot to subscribe. And the page numbers don\u2019t show up. So I need to click go to first ep a million times to get to the ep I\u2019m on \u2639\ufe0f","2171":"I loved this app a lot. Being able to read so many stories for free was great. My favorite being Hooky. I decided to reread it, but couldn\u2019t because of a daily pass. This pisses me off. The story was completed and now I have to wait a day just to read two chapters. Before it was perfectly fine. If I want to binge read any stories I already completed before, I have to wait or shell out. This is a huge turn off for me.","2172":"the amount of times ive cried over a webtoon! these creators are amazing at what they do! I just wish an archive\/completed section is added. So you save the webtoons you\u2019ve finished and it wouldn\u2019t be in the same list as the subscribe.","2173":"Hi this app is amazing and I love it. I get to read comics that make me think and wonder and exited for the next episode I really think you should get this app also I think the app works fine I never ran into any problems with it and I\u2019ve had it for a while \n\nSo thanks  creators for a cool app!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe","2174":"i\u2019ve used webtoon for a long time but i hate the new daily pass feature. i know it supports the author, but it restricts the reader like not everyone has enough money to pay for coins. also STOP WITH THE ADS!! i see them on many other websites for FREAKING ROMANCE it is literally so annoying, otherwise good app","2175":"I have been using this app and loving it for years, but they keep adding more and more advertisements in the app and it is ridiculous.  They need to cut down on the ads or make a paid version with no ads. Also daily pass is ridiculous. And if I unlock episodes they should be unlocked for ever not reset after 14 days.","2176":"I deleted it and it still sends me emails about the new comics coming in!! It\u2019s comics are amazing but I hate the fact you have to pay to read, or you have to wait to read \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\nYea yea I know that\u2019s how they make money but wht the heck it\u2019s reading I don\u2019t like that I have to wait! Great comics but deleted it in two seconds when I realized I had to wait to READ!!! \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11 download it!! if your willing to spend money, or wait for days to read one panel \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11","2177":"Why do I have to wait every day for a WEBTOON story that\u2019s already finished (\u201c1\/2 free ep. every day\u201d) But I do understand the FAST PASS cuz Ik that it helps the creators with coins.  For example I tried to reread \u201cwhere tangents meet\u201d,(keep in mind that it ended in 2016) but I couldn\u2019t cuz only 8 episodes were free which didn\u2019t make sense to me cuz how is this helping the creators at all. I guess it\u2019s time for me to get rid of the app it was fun while it lasted","2178":"I\u2019ve been a reader on Webtoons since 2018 and have put in a decent amount of money to read comics weeks in advance, and I recently went back to reread one of my favorites, Orange Marmalade, and I can only read 2 eps a day for free? I understand you want to keep making money, but there\u2019s a point where it just gets old. No apps are really free anymore. Either change the advertising, or remove the pass BS.","2179":"The overall app is great, but it gets ruined by one thing. The webtoon daily pass. For completed series, you are only able to read one comic a day unless you pay money. This means that it would take you over a year if you came back DAILY to read any decent length series. For any longer ones like I Don\u2019t Want This Kind of Hero? Over 4 years of nonstop returning to the app to be able to read a FREE and COMPLETED comic. Completely unfair and unreasonable","2180":"I LOVE this app, but I have a problem that I think has to do with my WIFI. I've been trying to read all these comics, but my screen will stay as the logo. I've tried waiting, but it's still the same. I really want to read my episodes. Hopefully I can find the source of the problem.","2181":"I\u2019m only giving this five stars to catch their attention . Whenever I go on the app it crashes and sends me back to the home screen. I have tried restarting my iPhone, also redownloading the app many times. Please fix this!","2182":"I really like webtoon a lot . I read them like everyday . I just don\u2019t like how when u reach a limited time u gotta get coins to watch the next episode..I just really wish I could watch all of them without having to wait 7 days !!\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude4c\u2764\ufe0f","2183":"It was working fine a week ago now every time I open a comic it says it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s every single comic I open.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019m starting to hate this app. This is the second time something like this has happened. I deleted the app to see if that would fix it and I ended up loosing all my progress in all the comics I was reading. The app is treating me as if I haven\u2019t had the app for years. I\u2019ve signed back in and it\u2019s still telling me there is an error. Fix this.","2184":"Before all this fast past stuff my webtoon was working fine but i noticed al the webtoons i\u2019ve subscribed too have not been updating on time. i do n fast past so it\u2019s kind of annoying that other people can read all to their hearts content and the people who are waiting patiently are experiencing delays for updates. is this happening to anyone else","2185":"I really like it, it gives me something to do when I am bored and it takes up my time there is no adds on so that\u2019s good and a huge variety of stories though it would be cool if we could download them so when there is not cell service or WiFi we can still watch them","2186":"Can you add a new update so we can reply to the top comment and not scroll to the botttom of the comments I found something funny so I was singing some kind of song like the no no don\u2019t touch me there but I see the top comment singing that and I just laughed  and I really want to reply saying \u201cI was just singing that!\ud83d\ude02\u201d but can\u2019t because I would need to scroll down :(","2187":"Why won\u2019t Webtoon open I tried and tried, i click on it and right when it pops up it closes, I even went to check for an update but there is none, all my other apps open up just fine","2188":"Ever since the update my app has been crashing nonstop. First time opening the app after the update I got kicked out of my account and none of my saved webtoons were showing up. Since yesterday, any time I click on anything it'll bring up a white screen and only a plus symbol and the word \"rate\" are visible then my screen locks up. I don't know what's up but I've never had problems with the app before.","2189":"I really love the app! it\u2019s great! But today I randomly got a very graphic sex game add. I do not appreciate that! it was disgusting! what if a younger kid saw that! I couldn\u2019t find a way to report the add. I am highly offended it was showing breasts, and girls sucking a mans privet, and more nasty things. you say this add is 12+ that did not seem age appropriate for a 12 year old. the romance novels I have read on here don\u2019t  have that in them. I see no need for this add! I\u2019ve seen adds on webtoon but nothing like that and I am very shocked and unimpressed!","2190":"I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for a bit of time now and now I need some stupid daily pass to read all the stories? I can understand the reason of it being changed but most of the readers on webtoon normally just blast through and choose to wait for more episodes when they reach the end. I\u2019ve just completely lost my want to read half of the stories now and I only stick to about 6. I can see I\u2019m not the only disappointed in this change.","2191":"It\u2019s been three days since it started doing this but, whenever I hit the like button it stays clear. I deleted the app and downloaded it again but it didn\u2019t help. Just putting this out there in case this is a shared problem you didn\u2019t know about. Thanks.","2192":"This app is so much fun. But I have some problems.. 1. It\u2019s super ridiculous that you have to wait so long to see the next episode. You  have to wait so long just for the next episode to come out. I have to wait 20 DAYS JUST FOR ONE EPISODE! And I know that I can buy cons to skip the wait but I don\u2019t have that kind of money. So please fix this waiting problem. But besides that it\u2019s a great app.","2193":"The app is great but it just started saying I\u2019m not connected to internet when I\u2019m running on data all the time and it\u2019s never been a problem! Please solve this, as all my other apps work just fine and have internet just fine through my data! Thank you!","2194":"I love this app, but the bugs make it annoying to use sometimes. Occasionally I\u2019ll open a comic and the app will simply stop responding, and other times I\u2019ll scroll to the bottom of a comic and it\u2019ll start opening ads and won\u2019t stop. But I really love having so many comics in one place.","2195":"This app is amazing. Great stories with so many different varieties and genres. The fast pass using coins you have to purchase is convenient and I love that it\u2019s not required to use coins to continue reading the web novel and can wait for a weekly update instead. Great app!","2196":"So I was reading webtoons and the creator had this screen that said \u201cdue to this new policy I can\u2019t show (etc)\u201d and that went on for a couple of episodes and I was really confused what had happened and I was completely thrown off so if you could get rid of that policy it would be great it is affecting a lot of readers and authors.","2197":"hello! i really love this app. there are many amazing stories on it and i almost never get bored. but i have to express some concern with the downloading. when i am downloading a chapter so i can read in the car, it will sometimes not complete, for just glitch out. therefore, i am forced to re-download it, but i can\u2019t, as it says i already have it downloaded. the thing is, though, i\u2019ll check my downloads tab and the chapter won\u2019t appear, or be there. it\u2019s pretty inconvenient, so i was just hoping you guys could fix this. that\u2019s the only reason i give 4 stars. otherwise, it would be 5.","2198":"So i\u2019ve had this app forever, but one day, it just logged me out. I tried logging back in everyday since, but it keeps telling me to retry later. Since i\u2019m not logged in, i can\u2019t see my subscribed webtoons. Otherwise, i love everything about webtoon. :)","2199":"I love WEBTOON so much I have had the app for almost 2 years but the only thing I wish they had was a night mode \ud83d\ude2d because personally when u wanna read at night the brightness bothers your eyes and even if u lower your phones brightness it\u2019s still really bright","2200":"I read a lot of WEBTOON but the policy means most of my favorite artists have to delete their episodes because of so called vulgar drawings and I\u2019m starting to not want to use WEBTOON anymore because of the policy. I think you should let artists put their drawings in WEBTOON even if there called vulgar because the artists work hard to create them.","2201":"I\u2019ve been using this app for 4 years now and have absolutely loved it until recently. \n\nWhenever I open up a webtoon the app will freeze and I\u2019ll have no choice but to exit and restart the app\u2014only for it to freeze again. 1\/4 times the app will work fine but it is a complete waste of time and effort.\n\nI have the updated version of webtoon and I am writing this review from an iPhone 6s but I have zero problems with other apps and services alike. The issue is solely with webtoon. \n\nI have even attempted deleting and redownloading the app but even that is useless. \n\nIf this issue could be fixed somehow and not ignored by the app developers that would be appreciated.","2202":"I love my WEBTOON. This week I noticed that my favorite comics weren\u2019t having their normal updates. After digging around I find my episodes hidden behind a paygate! \n\nAre artists being given a percentage of these micro transactions? Is it going to affect what is put on my front page in the future? The coins aren\u2019t cheap! \n\nI think it\u2019s a little shady that this change rolled in with the \u201ckid friendly\u201d policy. I\u2019m super bummed. I want to support the artists I follow on the app, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the direction the app is going.","2203":"I love it and it doesn\u2019t ask you enable to read this you have to sign in or any of that there is no limit for the comics and to be honest all these comics are awesome thanks for the authors of the comics and also for webtoon for making these comics which makes the app cool and fun!!!!\ud83e\udd70 keep going on and don\u2019t stop!","2204":"I\u2019ve been reading webtoon for over 2 years and seeing that coins are added is a huge disappointment a majority of readers are teenagers who can\u2019t pay to read a webtoon every week the reason i read webtoon is because it\u2019s free but now they just want to milk their fans for money and they\u2019ll be turning into one of the many greedy corporation and nothing will set them apart from the rest and i\u2019d hate to wish that their popularity goes down but if i\u2019m gonna have to pay every week i will","2205":"I still love WEBTOON and I have loved webtoon, but the new policy has really screwed things up. I get that webtoon is trying to make a more underage-friendly platform, but a lot of the artists whose stories involve a lot of mature content can barely post here anymore. I could understand the policy if it said that all artists had to put a warning before the beginning of each episode but saying they can\u2019t make these at all is a little much...","2206":"I love the app but it won\u2019t let me make an account it says I don\u2019t have an account with my email so I make one and it says I already have an account but that\u2019s fine with no account but now daily passes on completed series are just so annoying I can\u2019t really read anymore but it\u2019s a great app","2207":"I love WEBTOON but the new policy is making the app unenjoyable. Many of the creators are unable to really be creative due to the new policy. As a reader seeing a creator not being able to continue one of my favorite webtoon comics because of the new policy is really upsetting. I really wish webtoon would get rid of the new policy or at least make it less constrictive to the creativity of the webtoon comic creators.","2208":"yeah you know the deal, webtoon updated their policy where they yeeted mature content, and it's honestly a waste, really.. many creaters work really hard to make these comics and now they just gotta stop because of the policy, it doesn't only affect the creaters but also the readers who enjoy the content... call us pervs or whatever but i want the mature content back, and if webtoon is worried that kids will be reading the mature content, i honestly think that if the kids are mature enough to ask for it, they're mature enough to read it... other than that, i think you can find some really good series of different genres, i guess just no more mature ones anymore...","2209":"It\u2019s such a good app that allows other people to show their creativity through comics! The stories and comics are extremely good and even help aspiring artists and writers to get recognized. I totally recommend this app \u2764\ufe0f It has content for everyone, even 9 year olds! I recommend the story \u201cI love yoo\u201d and \u201cMy dear cold-blooded King\u201d!","2210":"Amazing artwork! Mind blowing storylines!!\nAnd for free!?!? After having this phenomenal app I have to tell you to make sure and subscribe. I let\u2019s them know that their work is loved and extremely appreciated! I can\u2019t express enough on how much I love this app and everything it has done for FREE!!! I thank you WEBTOON!","2211":"I am not one to throw money away, I have never had money to throw away. But I would without hesitation invest all my savings into future development and growth into this app, and I wouldn\u2019t consider it money lost because I would be buying many years worth of joyful experiences.","2212":"Love being able to read a lot except for some completed series. Can\u2019t binge some because of the daily pass. Would love to have the former scrolling feature back too which was when you can tap to scroll down a chapter. My wrist and base of thumb hurts sometimes now.","2213":"Could you put a more specific release time \nLike when a episode is about to come out it says free soon not a specific time so if you could change that so I know what time they come out and I can clear my schedule","2214":"I mean its wonderful all the stories are good and its very comfortable to read with. BUT why pay for every other chapter? its just incredible how much money youd have to spend if you bought all of them in each story you have to buy or wait. I get that they need money but why not make a subscription for all of them and pay each month?","2215":"It\u2019s been a few weeks since it kicked me out of my account and even if I change the password, it tells me it\u2019s incorrect each time! What do I have to do to get back on my account??? Overall, the app is wonderful and this is the only problem I\u2019ve had.","2216":"i really REALLY like the app it has the best stories but i wish it could be like a subscription where you can read fast pass episodes instead of having to buy a bunch of coins all the time. it\u2019s just my opinion and something i wish they could do. but i will still continue to use the app because i like the stories :)","2217":"The WEBTOON app was way better without the fast pass or the daily pass. I don\u2019t mind the fast pass but having a daily pass for already completed WEBTOONs just doesn\u2019t make any sense..... Please remove the daily pass for the completed webtoons. I used to use this app almost everyday but because of the daily pass, I do not use this app as often.","2218":"I love it is great one thing though..Please add something to see all the replies you get!!I see them pop up randomly for like 0.3 seconds and goes away! You have to go to the episode and scroll all the way to the comments to find it!!!I don\u2019t like it please add something to see the replies!!","2219":"for 7 years I have loved anime, manga, and especially webtoons and having webtoon has made it easy to read webtoons. Its a great app! however you have these things called coins to unlock episodes and you can only buy them. I wish that maybe offer free coins for people who don\u2019t have that money more often?","2220":"I have been a daily reader of webtoons for years and I love the app and changes they have made with fast pass and having to watch ads for an episode. However all of a sudden the app won\u2019t even load for me and immediately crashes! I hope it gets fixed soon","2221":"Webtoon is awesome, there is a lot of diversity in the comics and you can find lots of things that suit your taste. I\u2019ve had Webtoon for a few years now and I have been thinking about making my own comic, it\u2019s a very good platform to read and submit comics.","2222":"I absolutely love this app! One thing that I think would be cool to add though would be author profiles. So if you\u2019re reading a webcomic you really like you could press on the authors profile and see what other stuff they have published if they have. They could also have a summary about who they are and stuff","2223":"Overall, I love this app! But lately, I can\u2019t even open it! I still rated it 5 stars for now, but please fix this issue! It crashes the second I open it and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it twice already.","2224":"So I just LOVE WEBTOON like y\u2019all got me reading for hours and hours, and it\u2019s not a waste of my time. It keeps me occupied. But I think you guys should collab with Episode. Meaning episode makes some of their stories into Webtoons and Webtoon makes some of their stories into episodes. I would love that. Just sayin.","2225":"This is a great app. They have great stories and sometimes fun challenges. One of them was if you read 100 episodes in one week you get 5 free coins. I read 100 episodes and won the free coins. But when I tried to use it a few weeks later it said that I didn\u2019t have any coins.","2226":"I love this app it\u2019s very easy to read comics made by others however my phone has just recently gone through a new update and now webtoon says that I don\u2019t have internet or connection but I do and I\u2019m not sure how to solve this because I really love the comics. My phone is Apple and it got a new update. Please help","2227":"There were no daily passes. A few months ago, I could read a finished story without paying anything! Now, it\u2019s not so much like that. WEBTOON, you already make so much money when people buy coins for the fast pass, I don\u2019t get why you are charging extra just to read a finished series. The design and everything is good, but this won\u2019t get 5 stars from me until the daily passes are removed!","2228":"I\u2019ve only had this app for a few weeks now, but it easily became my favorite app. It simply washes your bordem away! Only thing is that I think there should be a VIP to get the next episodes instead of using coins. But I love this and I recommend \u201cTrue Beauty\u201d \u201cMy Deepest Secret\u201d and \u201cLets Play\u201d","2229":"I love y\u2019all\u2019s comics and every thing. However I keep trying to access blue chair and it won\u2019t load. It just stays frozen. This is the only web comic that I\u2019m having trouble accessing. I love the app that is why I am giving a five star. Thank y\u2019all for the content.","2230":"I\u2019ve now had to request refunds on multiple purchases for coins. There\u2019s been no change. I appreciate being able to read and see the ones I\u2019m following. But coins are not cheap and never being able to actually get what\u2019s purchased is frustrating. There\u2019s no help for how to report it besides having to go through all the iTunes hoops to just get a refund. I\u2019d like to be able to continue to read when I\u2019m in the mood to.","2231":"I wish you could just pay to have all of the stories unlocked already without having to buy 10 coins at a time. And to wait for a new story to unlock takes like a week. Wish this would be fixed and I don\u2019t see how you can even win free coins","2232":"The app itself and the comics I love, I just can\u2019t get a chance to read them! There is one major thing that annoys me. Sometimes I can\u2019t even enter the app. I will click on the app and I\u2019ll just be waiting and looking at the WEBTOON logo, waiting for it to fade out. Then after a good 20 seconds it will just show me my home screen again. I refresh and try again and refresh and try again but nothing! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something wrong with my phone but my WiFi\u2019s always great.","2233":"Im pretty new to this app and already i love it! Not gonna say that its my favorite app tho.. I really love the stories people have made. I've been on the app all day today! Maybe i shouldn't have but the stories were too interesting! But im lesbian and young so i dunno! \n\n(just wanted to add that last part ;) I mean its good to share your sexuality sometimes :) Hehe! Well baii!)","2234":"I loved reading WEBTOON. It was one of my favorite apps to read on but now the coin thing.. I have to but coins if I want to read comics that have a couple episodes up. And the only way to get coins is to buy them... which is not fair. I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if there was a way to earn coins (which I have not found). Might have to find a new place to read my comics.","2235":"It\u2019s an amazing app but, the new update\/policy is really annoying and it\u2019s ruining a lot of creators content\/stories. I\u2019m starting to get irritated when I see that my favorite WEBTOON is getting taken down or the creators have to stop writing their stories because of this policy. MANY people would be great full if you remove the new update","2236":"So I updated the app and was logged out again. Except this time, there was no option to login with my email. So I had to link with my LINE account and I don\u2019t remember all the comics I\u2019ve subscribed because I only open the app once a month... what\u2019s happening?? Can we have the option to login with email again? I love the app but the update is disappointing","2237":"Won\u2019t let me login. I registered my email, but when I go back to the app to login it says the email has not been registered yet. I have tried several times to login using the verification email that was sent to me. I even tried making a whole new profile but it says that the email I tried using for the new profile was already registered.... so when I go back to login with it it\u2019ll say that same email is not registered. Very frustrating.","2238":"I love webtoons but the new policy has been annoying me cause it just mainly ruins bl webcomic, and don\u2019t get me wrong I love this app cause it\u2019s like I\u2019m in my own world when I read the stories. I really love to read bl webcomics but the new policy has been taking away most of the parts. Please I hope you guys get rid of this policy and we will all continue loving this app. So this is why I\u2019m giving a 3-Star rating","2239":"So it used to ALWAYS work, and I had absolutely no problems. But then it started freezing up every other page, and sometimes I couldn\u2019t get onto another page for no reason... I don\u2019t know what happened, but I hope it gets fixed.","2240":"I really love this app there are so many amazing things to read and the authors are all so incredible.  But as of recently I don\u2019t know if I touched something but it doesn\u2019t do the auto scroll when I tap I know it\u2019s nothing major but could you please help.  Thankyou for this amazing app and have many wonderful days","2241":"Without a doubt one of the best entertainment apps out there. It is a place where you can read what ever you want ranging from romance to horror. There is something for everyone. My personal favorite WEBTOON is Uper Secret, a magical place where a where wolf and childhood friend falls in love with Emma, but there are a couple complications.","2242":"I like it so much because you can find pretty much any genre of story somewhere on here. Also most of the stories are from just normal people that got bored one day and decided to write a story, it makes them so much more relatable but still exciting.","2243":"I don\u2019t normally read anime, manga, or comics, but, I absolutely love this app!! I\u2019m so addicted to the incredible stories. The app is easy to use and completely free unlike other apps that offer stories like this. It\u2019s also add free which is amazing. One day I would love to go to Comic-Con and meet all my favorite authors.","2244":"Today as I was going on there to read it logged me out i didn\u2019t really thing anything of it until it said that my email wasn\u2019t even Registered I made a new one with the same email but I\u2019ve lost where I was reading and today was supposed to be my 5th day signing in","2245":"So I\u2019ve found some nice webtoons to read and the app is easy to use too. However, just recently whenever an ad pops ups right as I\u2019m reading a bubble. Now I wouldn\u2019t really mind that since WEBTOON does need to make some kind of money to keep up the app, but the ads tend to force close the app even when I watch through the whole ad. Is there a way to fix that?","2246":"I love this app. I can read the comics I like without being interrupted that I need more passes. This app has more than 1 genre and it's fun to read different ones. I love that you can make your own comics and have the possibility of getting promoted into the featured section. Very good app, I suggest getting it. \n\nGOOOOOOOOOO WEBTOON! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","2247":"I have a bunch of issues with webtoon now with having to pay to read old webtoons, fast passes and the screenshot limitations however today I\u2019m having an issue where I clicked a notification on my phone and now it\u2019s in Thai (I think). I can\u2019t read the characters to find the tab to change it back. There\u2019s nowhere I can find to report these issues either. It\u2019s an absolute mess. I miss 2017 LINE Webtoon.","2248":"I really like the app and all but I had a comic saved on my list that I was reading daily and once I was going to read it again it was gone and I could find it anywhere ! I think it would be a great idea to put a history to see all the comics that you didn\u2019t had to you list","2249":"I am a person who loves to go back and read old and finished webtoons. For example, I want to read noblesse. However, I can\u2019t do that because I have to have a daily pass.\n\nI don\u2019t want to pay money or anything like that to read finished webtoons. I can understand if you want to read ahead of some, but needing daily passes to read a finished WEBTOON is kind of crazy to me.","2250":"It crashes constantly every time one of those events pop up, and I try to join the event but it shows a white screen. This time the event (Spellbound) worked and all I had to do was click on my screen a bunch of times so the app wouldn\u2019t crash and every time I got a stamp I had to refresh my app. But the last stamp I got crashed my app and now every time I try clicking on the event, it doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t even receive the coins I deserve. Please fix this!","2251":"Like others I love this app but recently the daily passes they put with the completed comics really ruined it.  If it\u2019s completed we should be able to read it all the way through just like reading a book not wait an entire day to read the next chapter.  They may loose a lot of people with this new update and even new people who read the reviews.","2252":"I would rate this at a five bc this is just so awesome I love reading comics, and I would never stop reading the comics on here . And I have been reading creepypasta comics on here to thank you for making this app you should be grateful and is there ganna be a new update ? Please read this \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\n\nBy: jollyleaf","2253":"If it weren\u2019t for the daily passes webtoon would easily be 5\/5 but I\u2019m someone who has been on webtoon for 3 years. I have already read many of the older webtoons several times and read maybe half of the webtoon in one go. I already know what\u2019s going to happen next why must I wait for another day to just read the webtoon I love. It really makes me sad","2254":"I\u2019ve been using this app since forever ago and I recently wanted to reread a completed webtoon and theres\u2019s a daily pass that only unlocks 1 or 2 episodes per day. By the time I finish rereading this webtoon it would have taken forever and it only stays unlocked for 14 days with coins and daily pass. What kind of stupidity is this? Please get rid of the daily pass, how can anybody enjoy reading a webtoon like this.","2255":"After using this app for months with no issue. After the latest update i was forced to login again and when i loaded in I discovered all of my coins are gone after i just bought 200 coins they have disappeared i cant even read already purchased chapters. I love this app but its disappointing that i cant read stuff i already bought let alone get my coins back.","2256":"Use to love this app until one of the updates caused me log off from the account and apparently this means that any coin purchases you made is lost and cannot be retrieved. I thought this was a sick joke but nope it\u2019s in their website. Still waiting to hear back from there customer service but if you do use the app don\u2019t buy the coins once they are gone it\u2019s gone and no one will man up with a refund due to their crappy updates.","2257":"Downloaded this on a whim cause I was bored. Really enjoy several comics now. Like the function that puts a little emblem on the comics with new posts that day. Only thing is I wish that emblem would go away after I\u2019ve read the strip. Cause I get excited, then remember I\u2019ve already read that one today...","2258":"I\u2019ve only had WEBTOON for four weeks and it\u2019s very interesting! All of the different stories, all of the different characters, WOW. JUST, WOW! But I have 1 problem. When an episode of Lumine(my fav story) was almost unlocked, it changed back to 7 WEEKS. IT WAS ON ONE HOUR\ud83d\ude21.","2259":"So I\u2019ve tried deleting the app entirely and reinstalling but the buttons just aren\u2019t registering for me.\n\nLike I click on anything and it won\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ve waited, I\u2019ve tried pressing harder, nothing. I literately can\u2019t use the app. It\u2019s not my phone as I\u2019m able to use everything else just the same.\n\nI LOVE webtoon, I read everyday and I buy coins for those fast track readers. The fact that I can\u2019t use the phone app right now is really frustrating. \n\nBesides this problem it\u2019s a 5 star app and I love all the creators. I just wish I could use it!!! \n\nIf ANYONE has any suggestions or ideas to get it working again please let me know.","2260":"Hey Webtoon, I love your app, been using it for nearly 3 years now!! I just don't really like that you can only download the webcomics once. \n\nAlso I didn't understand was the canvas challenge, I read more than 100 episodes, but it kept saying I only read 48. Kinda confused by the Canvas challenge.\n\nOther than that, I love the app!!!\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04","2261":"Love the stories on this app. Everyday I discover something amazing to read. My only request is that you figure out a way to save the progress of the stories we read. Each time I download the app, I have to find where I left off and I\u2019m usually not accurate.  Please fix this.","2262":"Heya. There\u2019s is nothing itself wrong with app (that I know of-), but I do have a suggestion! Perhaps a dark mode would be well suited for this app? In sure others, including myself, would greatly appreciate this addition. Otherwise, this app is pure gold.","2263":"I LOVE THIS APP!! So good, I have had this app for 3 months and I thought \u201chey this is such a good app I should everyone about it\u201d and we\u2019ll I did. :3 you have to read Lumine it is by far my favorite story on WEBTOON it is so good!!!! Kody+Lumine it is, in my opinion, a must read! I hate that it is on hold right now...but it is sooooooooo goooodd. A good day to be a dog is good to but...not as good as lumine","2264":"I love this app. I like how many comics\/ manga is available, I love how diverse the stories are, and I like how there is free. One of the only reasons why this rating is not 5 stars is because I find it really dumb that under the recommendations for me is stories I already am reading. Like it would be great to get recommendations on stuff I don\u2019t know about.","2265":"This app is amazing and I love stories (especially tower of god). Only one thing, I can\u2019t login. The problem is my email. When I try to sign in it says the email is not registered, but then when I try to signup using the same email it says I can\u2019t because the email is already registered. Please help.","2266":"I finally find an app where I can enjoy free comics that are actually well done and worth reading. Webtoon became my ride or die and I started recommending it to others then out of no where \u201cfast-pass\u201d pops up like NO NOT YOU. The last app I thought would do this is webtoon. I\u2019m so very disappointed. Been reading since day one and then this happens. I feel like a disappointed parent. Like seriously the last app I thought would succumb to the evil was webtoon \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","2267":"I won\u2019t give you five stars until you fix this. I can\u2019t login at all and when I tried to sign up, it goes back to Email Address but I already put in my email address. I\u2019m sad to know that either way, I\u2019m can\u2019t get to my account. If you don\u2019t update this so all your fans can read this, then I quit. I\u2019m sad \ud83d\ude22 and heartbroken \ud83d\udc94! More than once I tried to login but it won\u2019t let me so what\u2019s the meaning of this, huh?","2268":"I loved this app so much and would come to it as a way to escape from reality by reading these amazing creators works, but now I\u2019m no longer able to do that. You know have to purchase coins in order to keep reading your favorite webtoon or wait 3 days to read the next episode!! If I\u2019m binge reading a story I don\u2019t want to wait to read another episode. The app was so much better without the coins, but now it\u2019s just like ever other app trying to get you to pay to read.","2269":"App is freezing immediately after opening multiple times after closing completely out. It is becoming very frustrating and is the only app of mine that does this. It use to not do this so there may be some bug that just popped up. Other than that I love the app.","2270":"To be honest I thought this app is the BEST I honestly love everything about it that is until the new policy came out...a LOT of the stories are being taken down and most readers are very upset with this and do not like this please do something about that even if it was censored it should still stay.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","2271":"I honestly love Webtoon but because of the new policy i feel like I won\u2019t be able to enjoy it as much anymore. I\u2019m very sad and disappointed by this because why would you take away the opportunity for other authors that want to make comics for us readers if they can\u2019t do what they used to love?please change the policy again and make webtoon a better app again!","2272":"I have been one that had enjoyed WEBTOON for a while now, but I really dislike the new policy. It has made it to where some of my favorite authors cannot display their work now because they may have some inappropriate content. I would very much appreciate it if the creators of WEBTOON would remove this policy and let the app go back to the way it used to be. Thank you.","2273":"I love this app!  It updates new episodes of my fav comics almost every day!! It has requests for you to read, and the comics are either hilarious, loving, etc. If you like comics books, I promise, you won\u2019t be disappointed when you download this app right now. Go ahead! Tap the button.","2274":"I loved this app a lot. And now because of the recent update a lot of the current comics have stopped posting. It put restraints and have made it so they cannot post links unless it directly relates to the comic. I understand it\u2019s so the more adult themed comics can be family friendly, however there are warnings and censorship. I still love the app but not as much anymore.","2275":"I absolutely love WEBTOON! They have great comics and a good navigation system. I would love for there to be a way to chat with other people on WEBTOON To see what comics they are reading and talk about comics. If that was added, I would be so excited. Please add this! Thanks for making such a good way to spend time!","2276":"User friendly interface and good stories... I\u2019m not a big fan of manga (not everything on Webtoons is manga but resembles it) but the stories are good and keep me entertained. I like how there\u2019s different comics that update everyday and there\u2019s something for everybody.","2277":"Have tried several Manga\/Anime apps before and this was the first to provide consistent and easy to find content.  Love their Discover feature and they seem to be improving stability with ever release.  Pretty stable now with minor and infrequent glitches.  Best Manga\/Anime app I have found so far.","2278":"Webtoon is just the best! Not only are the stories amazing, the art is so cool too! I love how you give others a chance to post their stories, whether they are good enough. Because you know that in fact, it's the readers choice. Thank you, for adding some reading into my life!","2279":"I have not yet found another app that allows me to read free comics it doesn\u2019t give you certain points to be able to read your next article You read as much as you want as fast as you want","2280":"Ok l love this app and all the different stories BUT it would like be amaze-balls if there were to be a section strictly for certain kind of stories such as BL\/GL because its hard trying to find them and i really dont like having to search when there can be a section specifically for those kinds...","2281":"Not only are the comics great and span a large variety of genres, but they\u2019re all 100% free to read. Most comic reading apps make you pay ridiculous amounts of money to read, but webtoon makes the experience high quality and (again) FREE.","2282":"The new children\u2019s policy is so annoying.\nI literally went on webtoon the day before I turned 13 years old, and I entered my birthday in. Since I was still a \"child\", I couldn't post any comments anymore. But it's been a week since I turned 13, and the comments are still locked for me. ;-;","2283":"This app used to be fun and a little some reading to do when your bored. But when you needed coins to read episodes i get off for 22 mins like it says but I forget and do something else. It\u2019s like the app is asking for the user to stop using it. It makes no sense. Yeah I know your trying to raise money and all but do it more efficiently and make people actually want to use the app. Thanks for reading and goodbye.","2284":"Now look I love WEBTOONs a lot but there\u2019s something going on with the app that\u2019s not allowing me to read it and I just recently downloaded the update and all of a sudden it\u2019s stating that my phone is not registered which it has been since 2018. So I\u2019m wondering what do I do at this point...So hopefully the team can reply and help me with this predicament....","2285":"It\u2019s so amazing the story\u2019s are so cool some are cute some are deadly the app is just great but when Was going on to read and daily passes it kicked me out of my account and I couldn\u2019t get back in even with the right info but I have a alt account so it\u2019s fine","2286":"For some reason I cannot comprehend, WEBTOON has read the criticism surrounding the three daily pass per day idea and as of 9pm today, decided to only give us 1 free episode. 1?!? This is truly an amazing app worth recommending and I understand that artists still need to eat, but srsly, this is ridiculous.","2287":"I love the app but here recently any time there is a challenge for coins the app freezes trying to pull up the info on the challenge so I never get to participate in them without freezing the app, along with that music on webtoons hasn\u2019t play for me for a few months.","2288":"I like this app but right now my WiFi is off and you have to have WiFi? Which makes me kinda mad because I wanna read it but once you open it you need WiFi. Not everyone has WiFi but they do have like LTE or use their data so I just wanna see if you can make this app not just for WiFi.","2289":"I hate having to wait for new episodes to come out so I pay for fast pass however I hate having to individually buy the episode I wish there was a way to pre order episodes if that makes sense","2290":"Tbh I don\u2019t think that the daily pass should\u2019ve been added because when the stories are being created we already have to wait for them to be released therefore when the WEBTOON comic is finished we should freely engage able to read them whenever we\u2019d like instead of having to wait AGAIN for the same story.","2291":"I love everything about this app.\n\nFirst, I love the fact that you do t have to be an \u201coriginal\u201d to post your art.\n\nSecondly, I think the fact that you can support the artists by patron, or buying the story ahead of time is wonderful, and very convenient. \n\nLastly, they have a section they dedicate to artistic talent that\u2019s not \u201cWEBTOON originals\u201d and that they have a chance to become partners with WEBTOON in the future.\n\nI will continue to spend money on the app, as well as enjoy free manga. \n\nThank you for your time and effort on a beautiful app that I\u2019ve enjoyed for years.","2292":"Ok! I\u2019ve been reading for a while now.. and I have to say, AMAZING! My favorite story has to be Ghost Eyes by Mr Circus Papa! It\u2019s amazing! ^^ I was recommended this app by my cousin and i have to thank her a lot about showing me \ud83d\ude05 I am thinking of starting a BL series but, I want to get all the sheets done first ^~^ Thanks for creating SUCH and amazing app!","2293":"The app content is good, but the reward ads won\u2019t load, so nobody is able to read the next chapters. From what I\u2019ve seen and experienced nothing works. All the internet connections are fine, people are restating their phones, redownloading the app, honestly WEBTOON needs to fix this before authors start to suffer cause nobody is able to read their content","2294":"There has been problem with my webtoons loading so I closed the app and waited a day to see if the problem would fix itself and came back to the same thing. Then I deleted the app and re- downloaded it to now not being able to sign in. Hopefully it can be fixed.","2295":"I accidentally bought coins on my phone because I thought it would go to my credit card but accidentally went to my dads and I can\u2019t refund and they also didn\u2019t say which credit card I was using","2296":"I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of notes from creators that they have to censor or even delete some panels because of the policy and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s really annoying for them and it\u2019s really annoying for the readers. Can\u2019t webtoon just do an 18 or older thing and make you put in your birthday? That way creators won\u2019t be prohibited from showing all their hard work.","2297":"This app is amazing no lie but I can\u2019t log in or make an account idk what to do so please help me or fix the app or something bc it won\u2019t let me do anything but read stories and I want to log in to make sure my progress saves but I wont let me do that. I may have to delete it I hope I don\u2019t have to tho bc I loved this app.","2298":"I love this app!! Different artists different story\u2019s of all kinds! But I wish you didn\u2019t have to pay to have a fast past! I think that after reading a certain amount of chapters of any story you should get a fastpast kinda like prizes! Overall really good! I suggest SubZero.","2299":"I don\u2019t know what happened but it says no service when I open the app and I\u2019m connected to wifi, even on someone else\u2019s wifi it still says no service. Please fix this, I love this app and everything it stands for.","2300":"I seriously love Webtoon and it\u2019s amazing comics, but when I was on hiatus from it I got back to it and while it was loading it just keeps loading forever, and immediately glitch me out, I tried to delete it and download it again but nothing seem to work, although it\u2019s great!","2301":"I love this app and the website, they are amazing. I only wish there was a way to look up your comments or an archive of sorts. That way if you need to edit or view replies you can without having to search through hundreds upon hundreds of comments trying to look for yours.","2302":"I have been a long time user of WEBTOON, probably for as long as I can remember actually and I\u2019ve always loved it. The coin system scared me a bit and the ban of NSFW content was a little disappointing but I never gave up on this app. Thanks for making such a good app creators!","2303":"As said in the Title I just can\u2019t access the app and I\u2019d hate to uninstall it for it will remove my bookmarks from previous experience, each time I open it, the app just freezes and it has nothing to do with my connectivity to my internet or when I am using Data I even close and reopen the app as well. Please help me resolve this issue other than uninstalling it, I don\u2019t want to lose my bookmarks. This has been occurring for the last 2 days now.","2304":"It is a very good app which I started using almost everyday now.. losing a star because of adds at the end of chapters and also a little bug where i cannot go to next chapter from inside, so i got to go to the list and go back inside in order for it to work again.\nRecommended!!!","2305":"The new policy is making many creators have to restart and is really hard to deal with when you are reading something and your hooked on it and then it changes so I would like to say that I dislike the new policy","2306":"i read webtoons all the time and i adore seeing everyone\u2019s own creations!! however i think getting rid of nsfw, even censored, is a bit annoying. People enjoy making things, and some people enjoy making nsfw!! it\u2019s understandable that you had a warning, and i think that should\u2019ve been fine. please get rid of this new update :( it\u2019s hurt some people\u2019s works, and ruined stories for others. thanks.","2307":"I loved this app so much. I still do for the most part. But in the recent weeks, there have been policy \nchanges which have restricted some of my favorite creators. Some creators have even chosen to leave this platform. I think the new policy changes are becoming very detrimental to the platform itself. Not          only are the creators frustrated, but we the readers are very frustrated at the fact that our favorite comics are having to go through changes to stay on the app.","2308":"I loved this app. It was perfect and had beautiful art and stories. But it's new Discover policy change has been doing everything to stop the hardworking artists from sharing their content. NSFW content is now entirely banned and links to other sites (including those used to support the comics) are also banned. It was a great app. Sad that they had to screw it up.","2309":"I don't even know how to start. I've had this app for a little bit and can I just say... wow! From Sirens Lament to Blue Chair, you will always love every single Weebtoon and you will be counting down the seconds till next week's episode. This app is my favorite app ever and is overall, stunning.","2310":"Webtoon is a nice site of comics, manga likes and other types of writing to take place of for a start, your work can be noticed, loved and criticized on to help improve som functions. I really like Webtoon and all of it's comics, giving updates on our favorite Webtoons. Best comic site I have so far.","2311":"This is the best app to use for really cool stories some are the cutest things only one problem though... I hate that some you have to buy but I'm glad we can wait for it to be free! Even though it takes years (not really) it's really good stuff! Love one story I'm hooked on its sad but SOOOO CUTE! The aliens so coot!","2312":"Literally Amazing \u203c\ufe0f I checked the app out since I was seeing lots of ads on it and I\u2019m so glad I checked it out \ud83d\ude06 I have never have been this interested in reading and if you haven\u2019t downloaded Webtoon yet go download it \u203c\ufe0f I loved Lookism, Sirens Lament, Late Bloomer, and many many others \ud83d\udc99","2313":"I love this So much. I've come to be addicted to it which isn't good \ud83d\ude02 But people are so talented and have created beautiful art and great storylines. And might I add ? (I'm just gonna be cheap and say) It's free LOl which makes it better there's comic apps that require monthly subscription or aren't totally free. I'd say to try :)))","2314":"It logged me out about 4 times in a month, each time I tried logging back in it said my email wasn\u2019t registered so I kept losing all my coins and subscriptions. I don\u2019t comment or do anything but read on the app so I know I didn\u2019t violate any rules.  Got so sick of it I only use the website now, I can\u2019t skip ahead on chapters but it\u2019s better than losing my subscriptions again. So disappointed in this app!!","2315":"I love WEBTOON and all but somethings needs to be changed. My account is always being signed out and was recently deleted. I had my email in my account but it\u2019s saying it has never been \u201c registered\u201d yet a few days before it was perfectly fine. Everyday I want to use WEBTOON, I have to sign back in and put in my info again. I spent over 25-30 bucks on this app. I\u2019m not happy with this app right now.","2316":"This app was awesome but when I leave and come back it asked for my password,email,name,address,re Wright my password and a bunch of other stuff but those stuff are privacy and I like it of course of I just don\u2019t like putting private information","2317":"i love webtoon i\u2019ve been using it for awhile but when i went on the app today i remember having 20 coins but now those are gone, i didn\u2019t use a fast pass im sure of it & nobodys been using my phone. I\u2019m not sure what happend but i hope you can fix this issue just incase its happend to anyone else :)","2318":"I love this app so much because I get to read so much fun and interesting comics! The only thing I don\u2019t like is that I have to buy coins to continue reading because some little kids don\u2019t have money to buy coins so now they have to wait to read it!\ud83e\udd15 but other than that I love it!","2319":"I love this app but there isn\u2019t a ton of stories that aren\u2019t child friendly, most of them are for adults. So I suggest more WEBTOONs with drama packed stories but are on the child friendly side. But otherwise I love the app and can\u2019t wait to go read my topaz stories!","2320":"I love this app. There is a huge variety of stories you can read and it\u2019s great. I remember when I used webtoon a while back we could always get to the new posted episodes but now the have fAsT pAsS which makes you have to PAY for episodes or wait a whole week \ud83d\ude10","2321":"I love the platform and layout of Webtoon, but there is one thing I think could change. It would be nice if you could double click to like an episode or a comment, such as social media\u2019s set up. It would be great if webtoon did this! Besides this, I LOVE Webtoon.","2322":"I read on my iPad, and I was really happy to discover that the comics will switch to landscape mode, but can you please make the entire app have the option of landscape mode??  I hate having to turn the whole thing just to read the menu, and then turn back to enjoy the comics without having to hold my iPad upright.","2323":"Staring off this app is so amazing there just this problem that keeps making me mad it\u2019s that when I Reading it suddenly freezes and I have to restart the app again so it can work and it\u2019s constantly lagging and freezing I hope you can fix this bug","2324":"You know how now you can watch adds for episodes instead of buying coins? Well my adds won\u2019t work and it won\u2019t let me watch them. When I click watch add for episode or whatever it says go to settings and click advertising an then reset advertising identifier which I\u2019ve done multiple times but it\u2019s not working. I have the latest update. Any ideas of what I can do? I love WEBTOON but there\u2019s no where to go for this.","2325":"I really loved the WEBTOONS, but one day, I couldn\u2019t open the app on my phone or my iPad. I tried deleting it and downloading it again, I\u2019ve tried updating it, but nothing seems to work. I really do love Th is app, but I cant even open it.","2326":"Uh so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019ve been having a similar issue as other users. The app isn\u2019t loading anything. I even redownloaded the app and now it\u2019s even more broken. It refuses to let me login, and basic functions no longer work. Please fix this, it\u2019s been 2 days and I cannot even use the app!","2327":"I found your website first and was super excited to see you offer Sign In with Apple! I setup my account with Sign in with Apple on your website then found your app. Sadly I cannot Sign in to your app because it\u2019s missing the Sign in with Apple button\u203d \n\nPlease update and add the Sign in with Apple button to your app!","2328":"I live WEBTOON like I love to read comics online however when I do I find a comic I really enjoy and try to look for the next piece however I can not. So my whole family told me bout WEBTOON when I got it I couldn\u2019t believe it I found the comics that I was looking for and got to read everything! I love WEBTOON","2329":"I would love it if you guys could put some kinda of way to get free coins. #collegestudent\n\nLike watch ads for coins?? I hate that I\u2019d have to wait for a whole week just to read like 3 minutes worth of an episode. \n\nThat would awesome... love the app tho!","2330":"It keeps saying there\u2019s no connection , and keeps saying there\u2019s an error loading and all these shenanigans. I love the comics on here and the people who make them work hard for others to read them . Please fix the app \ud83d\ude2d","2331":"I love WEBTOON uwu, but I have a suggestion. It would be really helpful if you could publish on mobile! It would help so many publishers who don\u2019t have a computer and want to publish easily without safari :) if you added this in I\u2019m sure webtoon would make very good reviews! Thanks","2332":"I downloaded WEBTOON because I wanted to read fun stories but on WEBTOON you can only read what I estimate to be around two pages per comic strip on the types of stories that I am reading and and you get two pages every week I don\u2019t want to wait a whole seven days just to read more than like three pages I should be able to read a story and just be able to read the story PERIOD! So yeah that\u2019s my complaint.","2333":"Okay I love webtoon I love the how it works I only have 2 problems 1st the New Policy it\u2019s making it hard for authors to write there story\u2019s some of my favourite comics are having to switch to other apps please get rid of the new policy 2nd please add a BL category to the discovery section thank you","2334":"This App takes FOREVER to load every single panel. Full WiFi, no background applications, no reason at all for such a slow program. I understand downloading the comic would illuminate this issue but not everyone has space or time on their phone to download each comic. Literally every panel has to be uploaded one by one. Then whenever I try to go onto the next chapter the whole app crashes. Very disappointed. Make real improvements on your app!","2335":"There is seriously something wrong with this app now. After the last update, nothing works. I can\u2019t read anything because of system errors. I lost my coins, it won\u2019t let me log in, it won\u2019t let me recover a password. It keeps telling me I\u2019m not connected to the internet when I clearly am. I uninstalled and reinstalled it and nothing has changed. What is wrong with this thing?","2336":"I\u2019d like to say I\u2019ve been a \u201cwebtooner\u201d for a couple years now ever since my cousin showed it to me. It really had inspiring comics\/webtoons out there written and illustrated by amazing authors and artists. I\u2019m particularly 100% in love with this app. But just one question; would there be another update of somehow downloading a comic again?","2337":"Love the app, love the stories, but I\u2019ve started experiencing times where the app would just freeze and restart. It happens when I\u2019m trying to read a chapter and I\u2019m scrolling. Not sure if it\u2019s a bug or if it\u2019s my phone acting up.","2338":"Love the app, however, the whatever the policy is that disallows the sex scenes is kinda disappointing. Also, the coin system is also a little disappointing. Recently, within the past two days of writing this, I cannot see which webtoons have been updated because I \u201cam not connected to the internet\u201d, when I actually am.","2339":"It\u2019s an awesome app don\u2019t get me wrong I love the comics on it . The only thing is that it\u2019s been freezing on me when I open the app. Like I open it and after a couple of seconds it freezes and I can\u2019t tap or scroll at all so I close it and try again but still the same thing again","2340":"The new policy as many others have said is kind of upsetting because there was a restriction before for going into the 18+ or so on and if someone still clicked on it and the that there would be inappropriate content it was there fault not the creators. All I\u2019m saying is you should remove the new policy.","2341":"Ok, so as you know WEBTOON made a new policy for the people on discover and it has not made anything better in fact it has made some people quit WEBTOON and join Tapas or other websites. The new policy is not appreciated and has not made anything better although this is a great app, it is strict with the rules for discovery. Please change this.","2342":"At first it was really great, everything was awesome, until they added a new policy. Many artists had to stop their webtoons because of it, many fans lost the comics that they loved and I am one of those fans and I just want that policy to be lifted and so no one can have problems with it anymore","2343":"I was Reading a book called down to earth and I was at the end then I figured out there was a daily pass I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called can you please change that I love to read and learn more words so please please change it I don\u2019t have much time so that it (=3","2344":"Love this app. So many options to read from and a platform to explore your own interests in writing\/drawing as well. Every week there are some webtoon updates to look forward to. :)","2345":"I can't find a way to describe how awesome the app is. \nPlease use it to see the professional work done by webtoon team.\nNot only as a comic fan, but also as an engineer I commend the functionality, design and usability of the app.\nAnd all of that is free with no ad crap.\nProps folks!","2346":"I find Webtoon extremely enjoyable to use!!! My friends and I will share webtoons that we love and read them. Also I got my first top comment the other day and I was a little to exited about that. Thank you for creating this wonderful app!!!","2347":"I used to have this app and would go on it almost everyday! Reading without limitations was so fun to me but now there\u2019s \u201cdaily passes\u201d. I suddenly remembered the webtoon \u201cGirls of The Wild\u201d and decided to reread it. When I opened the app I couldn\u2019t even binge because of the \u201cdaily passes\u201d Very disappointed that a reading app would put such a restriction on reading. Have a good day \ud83d\ude10","2348":"So recently I found out that Webtoon bought Wattpad and they are removing mature books to make it more kid friendly...it is a 17+ app of course there are going to be mature books. Also what kind of kid is going to wake up and be like \u201cI\u2019m going to download wattpad and read SpongeBob goes on a hike.\u201d LITERALLY NO KID WILL EVER DO THAT.  Basically what i\u2019m trying to say is worry about your own app and stop ruining wattpad by taking down some of the best books on there please and thank you <3","2349":"Webtoon has really good and interesting story but The thing I do not like is that there is a lot of murder stories and killing so I think they should take it off because some people might get a crazy thing for it and might the same thing which I worry it\u2019s good but I do not like the killing or murder\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude12","2350":"Love the app and the people on there, the comics are amazing and the they are drawn. But I wish if the app was deleted I would have all the data on it, I say this because my sister deleted it in rage from our fight and I lost everything...","2351":"I have had webtoon over a span of 5 years on different devices and let me tell you. This app has gone down in quality, not the stories rather the way it\u2019s managed. With all these ads and coins you need to buy. they used to say this app was the best because it was free there was their slogan and now five years later pretty much everything you want to do cost something.","2352":"i have been using the webtoon app for about a year or two now and i love the stories, the layout and the community! however, daily pass is aggravating. i\u2019ve already read stories like orange marmalade and ghost wife but i feel as through waiting each day to read two chapters is a bit ridiculously if i\u2019ve already read these chapters... would it be too much to revisit them? i think maybe if you\u2019re a new reader then wait? but even then i think that\u2019s doing too much and every reader should have free automatic access to a webtoon.","2353":"Webtoon is my favorite app I love the comics but I wish the app gave you the option of the comics being read to you my arms get tired and I don\u2019t want to stop reading the comics the app has so many good comics I recommend downloading the app it\u2019s really amazing","2354":"It was going great for a while then a few days ago it just stopped working, saying \u201cno internet connection\u201d. I tried deleting it and reinstalling it but that didn\u2019t work, powering off my phone and then reinstalled it, still didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing wrong since everything else works just fine","2355":"THE APP WAS BETTER BEFORE YOU GUYS MADE THIS UPDATE AND YOU SEE THAT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON HERE WETHER ITS GOOD OR BAD REVIEWS IS TELLING YOU THIS FAST PASS AND COIN UPDATE IS NO GOOD AND SINCE YOU GUYS HAVENT RESPONDED TO ANYONE MENTIONING THIS AS IVE SEEN SO FAR I CAPITALIZED IT SO ITS A LITTLE BETTER FOR YOU TO SEE IT.  Anyways thanks, seriously consider TAKING it down. I used this app for year's and left it for a while to come back to this garbage now. I mean don't get me wrong, I love the stories of course but to spend MONEY on it and what if I want to re-read it? I guess I can't now. I find it ridiculous that you have to pay for it....","2356":"So I just had to delete the app bc I just got a new phone, and then I downloaded it again and logged in with my recent account, but all of my coins were gone that I paid for, and all of my webtoons were gone that I subscribed to. It\u2019s an overall great app, I\u2019m just upset that every thing reset and the coins that I spent money on are all gone.","2357":"I love webtoon im very interested in a series called \u201cim the grim reaper\u201dive watched 54 episodes but now I have to wait 7 days to get the next episode by then I might lose intrest in webtoo and might delete it. If anybody at webtoon is seeing this please make it like 1 day for a few episodes please I would use webtoon alot more and it would make my day! Besides epsode time it is my favorite app at the moment","2358":"This app is so perfect because of how it organizes all of your topics and how the authors could express themself by sharing their talents to the world I want to thank the creator and all the artists for this amazing app if I could I would nominate this app as the best app for relaxing and indulge in reading with beautiful artwork","2359":"While in the middle of binge reading noblesse (one of the most popular completed webtoons on the app) I am suddenly hit with a paywall that didn\u2019t exist before. Now if I want to read something that has been out for years I have to pay or wait 2 weeks, absolutely despicable. I would rather go read on some third party site.","2360":"I love this app so so much, the stories are amazing and it gives me something to do. Buuut...I don\u2019t know if this is normal or not but whatever app I use (Pandora,Spotify,SoundCloud) I can never get my music to work with this app...but it hasn\u2019t stopped me from loving WEBTOON and I would definitely suggest you check it out UwU","2361":"I\u2019m not gonna hate or anything, I love Weston but when the fast pass and the other things came up, it really made me mad cause like we\u2019re only reading like why do we have to pay to be able to read? That\u2019s not cool, and pls change that, I\u2019m also forgetting about the mangas because of that. So pls change it and thx","2362":"This is awesome!!! I only have two days that I got it, I already read a whole entire story the name is the four of them is about drama and romance I\u2019m reading another one that the name is cursed princess club, is the best app that I ever had I recommend you this app a lot.","2363":"There\u2019s 2 or 3 comics on there that I read that are exclusively on the app. Everything else I could find on other websites. You have watch ads to see the last eat chapters sometimes. Using coins to get ahead for chapters is a waste of money.\nThe community is awful, I never want to comment on anything and there is always spam accounts that just spam links to porn in the comments sections.","2364":"I used to love it. But now there\u2019s this new thing where I have to watch an ad to access the latest episode of a webtoon. It\u2019s terrible. \nI read webtoon a to relax and I always loved that I could enjoy comics without being jump scared by pop ups, like on so many other apps. Now it\u2019s just annoying. The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I\u2019m loyal to writers. This new ad revenue grab can bite it.","2365":"As of the latest update, the app won\u2019t work! Nothing I tap on works and it\u2019s really frustrating. I\u2019ve had the app for a while but I\u2019ve been on it for a while. Because of this, when I went on it\u2019s week ago, I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I figured it was a WiFi problem or something. However, after reading som reviews here, I see that it was a problem with the app itself. Please fix!!!","2366":"Tbh I only downloaded it because of the ads on Snapchat and thought it was kinda dumb but as soon as I started lore Olympus I loved it. The pictures are great and the story is amazing. 10\/10 would download again","2367":"i was using the app just the night before and in the morning when i wanted to read it, i noticed it was updating. after the update, the app became incredibly laggy, to the point where i cant even click any buttons. i thought it was just a problem due to my older phone (iphone 6+) and the newest update wouldn't be compatible so i deleted it and downloaded it again only to find out that it was still a problem. \n\ni know with the pandemic going around, there will be more people using this app as a way to kill time but the newest update is incredibly underwhelming and not efficient at all. please release another update soon to fix this bug","2368":"I really enjoy WEBTOON I read almost every single day but I hate that once I download an episode and it expires I can\u2019t download it again (there should be able to be renewed). This has happened multiple times now and it really bugs me. Please fix this problem because it prevents people from seeing their favorite WEBTOON offline. Thank you","2369":"I love this app! I was reading a book tonight and my phone died and now i can\u2019t find the store! And it\u2019s not in my recently read for today. I don\u2019t even remember the name. What do I do?","2370":"Webtoon offered a challenge to log in every day from November 9th- December 9th where if you check in you will get some in app currency. I was ONE DAY away from completing the challenge but an update wiped all my progress. \n\nIdk if it was accidental or if Webtoon had this as a plan all along to not give in their promises but it sure seems awful convenient that the business quarter ends soon, and they would want to have good return numbers to show management.","2371":"This app usually works, and when it does, it works great, and I love it! But every once in a while, when I press on the app, it shows the logo, like it does, and then it kicks me out of the app! The app will not let me in for about a week, and then everything goes back to normal. I don\u2019t know why it does this but it can be very annoying.","2372":"I\u2019ve had this app for a week or so and just today it started having problems. It keeps saying I don\u2019t have any internet connection. Like at all. I\u2019ve turned off my WiFi and even put it on a different connection, but it still acts like I\u2019m in a dead zone and can\u2019t do ANYTHING. Can someone help or get back to me on this??","2373":"I\u2019ve been using this app like forever... it has many great stories and plots! Just a little bug. If I use the app too long, it exits out of the app without saving where I was. Please fix this bug. Otherwise the app it\u2019s cool.","2374":"It\u2019s great but when I go to like comics it won\u2019t let me. This only happened every once in awhile and I could just exit and like it again and it would work but now nothing works. Webtoons has a lot of comics and I love it.","2375":"I love this app, and they allow a great range of reading a material, and I love keeping up with the comics. I was trying to start my own webcomics, but I can only do that on the desktop. Is there a way to change it so on mobile you can post comics, too?","2376":"I had to download the app to another phone because mine stopped working. Even though I logged into my account and all of my series were there, it didn\u2019t save any of my bookmarks and I have no idea where I was. That said, I really enjoy the app and all of the stories","2377":"Thank Creators for making this beautiful app! This app made me laugh, and feel joy when I thought I was alone. Thank you players for creating such amazing storylines, And thank you commenters for making me laugh\/smile at your hilarious comments.\n\n                  \ud83e\udd73  CAN WE GETTA WHOOP WHOOP!! \ud83e\udd73\n                            God bless y\u2019all!!!!!","2378":"I personally do like this app for reading comics. But my only concern is that I would select a title or an episode and it would constantly say that it can\u2019t connect to the network. I am not 100% sure this is all their fault, but even though I am connected to a network it will just keep popping up.\n\nI do hope you fix this!","2379":"Been gone for a month because of a trip, but once I came back it kept on saying that there is no connection despite being connected to WiFi. \nPlease do something about this.","2380":"I love webtoon and I read it everyday but after the recent update, webtoon just won\u2019t open. I\u2019ve tried deleting and redone loading t but it still won\u2019t work. I have a iPhone 6 and I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s not working :\/\/\/ \n_\nBut other than that, webtoons are amazing and you should definitely download this.","2381":"I love this app. Highly recommend. My only question\/problem. I need this app to stop sending Email\/Gmails to me. I have overprotective parents and they found out I have this app and their making me delte it. The only way they found out was by going trough my Gmails. Help ya girl out here\ud83d\ude29","2382":"Whenever I try to buy fast pass coins it seems like it will work, then it asks for my \u201cverification\u201d. I enter it and it says I need my Apple ID password yet doesn\u2019t say where to enter it. Is this a bug\/glitch or just a new update?","2383":"I really like the content. The thing I really hate is that they place the advertisement at the end of the comic and I keep hitting the ad everytime I scroll down. It sends me to a open the app store all the time while I am reading. This is really frustrating to me. I hope the designers find another way to display their ads without interrupting.","2384":"I think it would be a great idea to let people dub the comics so the reader can now listen to the story I also believe that it will give more of a tv show kind of vibe thank you for reading and please try this maybe it will be a hit","2385":"Webtoons is an amazing app where people all over the world can share their talents. It has introduced me to son many amazing stories and I love them all and Webtoon for it. The new policy has made many of the creators have to rewrite or even stop posting their comics. Many people are very upset, including me. This new policy is awful!","2386":"HEYYY!! This app is amazing!!\nJust I wish that we didn\u2019t have to pay for coins, but that\u2019s alright!\nI am reading 3 daily pass WEBTOONs right now and they are all great! My fav WEBTOONs are \u201cIt\u2019s Mine\u201d \u201cSweet Home\u201d and \u201cDays Of Hana\u201d!\nThis app makes me happy and excited for the next chapter to come out!!! I also like binging some of them that i never read before! I also like that some of the WEBTOONs you only have to wait like 3 days to come out for the new chapter! \ud83e\udd70\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70\u26a1\ufe0f \nIf anyone wants to start getting better at reading, I DEFINITELY recommend this app! It has so many types of genres that I enjoy!\n\nSincerely, \ud83e\udd0dLuvobx\ud83d\ude0c","2387":"This is my favorite entertainment app in a long time. I've been using it for 7 months now, and I spend hours reading comics. WEBTOON has a great library for content related to what you read. \n5\/5 stars and I recommend this app to people.","2388":"There is so much good content on this app that it\u2019s unbelievable, and the fact that it\u2019s updated all the time with new things to read, just makes it ten times better. All in all I\u2019d recommend this app to any\/all of my friends.","2389":"I usually try do do a thing where it\u2019s the tilt leg and the same thing in the actual review but for this app I\u2019m not because it\u2019s my favorite app there are many stories to read and they are all interesting in their own ways","2390":"I\u2019ve had other webcomic based apps and they always wanted payment but WEBTOON is a fast,free,and easy way to read amazingly funny,beautiful,heart touching comics. I\u2019ve never had any problems from WEBTOON, their updates are always constant and don\u2019t slow the app down.","2391":"I\u2019m happy WEBTOON has started accepting advertising. However, every time a pop up ad happens, the app crashes! I can\u2019t even get through one comic without this happening. What\u2019s the point in even having them if you can\u2019t read any of the comics? \n\nI really love WEBTOON, it\u2019s a really great creative community. I do recommend it to anyone looking for a big variety of comics. Whenever this stops, I\u2019ll be more than happy to change my rating to a 5, but until then it\u2019s staying a 1.","2392":"I was forced logged out of my account today, it doesn\u2019t recognize any logins anymore. I had to create a new account with the SAME EMAIL and all my coins that I paid for are gone, as are my subscriptions. If they can\u2019t fix it I\u2019m reporting them to Apple.","2393":"I love webtoon but there is one problem..... I can never finish my series because I have to watch an ad to read the next one but the thing is; I can\u2019t play an ad it always says that it can\u2019t load ads. So please fix this really soon so I can finish this series","2394":"This is the best app hands down, this should be a 4.5 star review though because it can\u2019t be hard to find a good series after you finish your other ones, also this is a personal question, but what is the series with the brown haired olive skin mermaid called? I CANT FIND IT AND I NAMED THE GUY NIKO","2395":"So I was reading on this app and when every time my finger is on my phone screen for more then a few seconds a CAMERA unexpectedly pops up and slowly starts facing me and it\u2019s like a video and I know for sure it not an ad it just very creepy I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a a bug in Webtoon but it creeps me out I did my research and it seems to happen to other WEBTOON users but other than that the stories are great!-","2396":"I am not happy with this app right now. First it log me out and when I logged back into my account, my coins and unlocked chapters were gone. I know for fact that I had at least 25 coins left, but now they completely vanished. I spent money on those coins.\n\nPlease fix this fast. I like the app overall and the stories on here are great, but this new update has caused a lot of problems. If this problem is not fixed I am will delete this app","2397":"Bruhh these stories GOES HARD. it makes me feel like ill never get love in my life \u2764\ufe0f a bit jelly over fictional characters. BUT, I literally have no friends so I just go on here for hours at night till the sun rises \ud83d\ude0d the life I HAVE! 10\/10 would recommend \ud83e\udd38\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","2398":"This daily pass update is... so inconvenient. I was reading Home Sweet Home, like 20 chapters before the last episode, and when the update happened I realized I couldn\u2019t read from where I left off, I have to start at the beginning. This is the issue.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t read finished webtoons at our leisure.","2399":"I\u2019ve purchased a few chapters now of different series, and after every each purchase I\u2019m getting an error about a screenshot detected. I\u2019ve double checked my photos app multiple times to make sure I don\u2019t actually have anything screenshotted, and I definitely don\u2019t. This only started happening today and I\u2019m not sure what the issue is, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to contact support other than leave a review...","2400":"I updated the app bc it said I needed to in order to get coins from the 5-day survival event, but after I did that I 1) didnt get my coins, 2) the app crashes when I open the event from the banner, and 3) now the Prop I ad keeps randomly popping up while Im reading a comic. Please fix this.","2401":"The only thing I don\u2019t like is that I have it on multiple devices and it doesn\u2019t transfer everything. Sometimes I read on my iPad but then I leave and want to read on my phone but idk where I left off and it\u2019s frustrating","2402":"I used to love Webtoon until fairly recently, where even when my phone was on airplane mode, the battery would drain significantly and webtoon would be using 100% of my battery over the night, leaving my phone almost completely drained in the morning. Please fix this severely alarming bug in an otherwise great app, otherwise I am uninstalling.","2403":"This app is great and I have been using it for over a year but as of this morning I have gotten kicked out of my account. Not only that but it won\u2019t even let me open the app. Is this a problem with the recent update or just me. If it is with the update please put a patch, I really do not want to lose all my webtoons \ud83d\ude30. Thank you","2404":"Once I had to uninstall the app then reinstall it just to get it working again and it crashed a couple times but other than that it\u2019s an amazing app I love all the books my favorite is cursed princess club!","2405":"Besides all the cringe comments, the only problems with the app happen during downloads. There\u2019s no option to select multiple downloads for deletion so that gets really tedious. Also you can\u2019t like downloaded episodes, you have to keep the app open to download. Also if you update the app, all your downloads turn into blank pages.","2406":"I thought WEBTOON was like one of those weird apps that you pay to watch things but now I\u2019m hooked onto it I blame you WEBTOON the only thing i don\u2019t like is the wait times but if you read a bunch of story\u2019s it makes up for that I just blame you WEBTOON for getting me to love this","2407":"I don\u2019t know if this is just me, but I can\u2019t enter the app. Every time, it kicks me off after a few seconds. It\u2019s been working fine up until now. Is anyone else having this problem?","2408":"I absolutely love the creators on here, but the app keeps unsubscribing me for some reason to some of the stories. Usually I wont notice until one of the stories pop up in my recommended and then I\u2019m like Oh are they posting again? Wait why am i not subscribed? Other than that I love this app","2409":"I don\u2019t like how u have to wait 17 days just to read one page. A lot of people would have this app if you could read how many chapters you want. I like this app but I don\u2019t like waiting. Especially in quarantine \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33","2410":"I was logging into the webtoon app to read the update of a story and it just had a white screen once I clicked the story\nAnd it won\u2019t load\nI\u2019ve been using the website but would like if maybe this is just a bug and hoping it gets fixed\nStill an amazing app though!","2411":"What\u2019s up with an app that has sound, plays the sound even when your phone is on silent mode, and has no way to turn the sound off in settings? I went to help, searched for sound, no responses. There\u2019s no way to ask a question or contact someone. Wow, horrible, thoughtless, disruptive design. I don\u2019t want your noise, and apps that play sound when my phone is on silent mode are trash. It earned this one star.","2412":"When I created an account and tried to sign in it would work saying I did something wrong when I did everything the same! Please fix this, I got this app so I could read comics sooner but this is just preventing me from doing that.","2413":"I really enjoy reading in english but it\u2019s hard when u want to read some other webtoon any only available in other language . I really want to read other webtoon like the second marriage or my bad boyfriend but it\u2019s only available in Indonesian language. I hope you guys improve on that but over all i really like it. Thank you.","2414":"I love the app a lot and it\u2019s amazing and all but....the little fast pass thing is kind of annoying, like why should we wait an extra 6 days for just 1 more to come out when they\u2019re already done. It gets really annoying. but besides that it\u2019s really amazing.","2415":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO READ MANGA! No other app will fill my needs like this one! It\u2019s a must-have! You need to have the app if you haven\u2019t downloaded it yet! It has original stories, and it hooks you to whatever you are reading! My favorite is let\u2019s play, check that one out!","2416":"ITS SO AWSOME! I can\u2019t stop... when I can\u2019t sleep Guess what I do! Watch this... help me... anyway It\u2019s the best. I LOVE THE COMICS!!! I\u2019m so addicted! My friend started. THEN my brother started. So at that point I gave up and got it... And now I can\u2019t sleep! That may sound bad but to me is great!!!                            \n\nPs. This is the best rating I have ever given!","2417":"It\u2019s a good app but I tried playing music but it wouldn\u2019t let me. Every time I try to play music it would stop it when I go on the app. And I can multitask by the singing to music and reading it\u2019s not that hard they probably thought so... But everything else was fine though.","2418":"THIS IS AN AMAZING APP!!! I personally have loved anime for a long time and never thought about reading comics but this is great!! And on top of it all your not bombarded by ads or anything. 1000% recommend downloading for a good time waisted especially if u love anime or anything like that like cartoons! :)","2419":"I personally have seen no issues with the app so far. The stories are truly incredible and there are some very talented creators on this app. I personally recommend Bastard, Unordinary, and Let\u2019s Play. However if you dislike romance don\u2019t read Bastard or Let\u2019s Play.","2420":"It\u2019s a four star because when I try to login it tell me there\u2019s a problem so I tried it again in two days and still dose not work then I delete it then install it again and login but it still dose not work that is why it\u2019s a four star.","2421":"I got this app over a year ago and to this day I\u2019m still reading comics. I don\u2019t get on everyday because if I did, I probably wouldn\u2019t sleep or catch up on work, but when I do I stay up late catching up on comics and starting new ones c: Absolutely love it","2422":"I'm a little upset we can only subscribe to only 100 discover comics because it's a little sad to remove some just to add more \nThere are so many amazing comics on discover\nThe limit just makes me sad \u0ca5_\u0ca5 \n\nOn another note I really love webtoon (*^\u25bd^*)  \u2661\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\u2661","2423":"I used to love WEBTOON so I cannot give it one star, but the new policy is just....SO STUPID!\nWEBTOON is supposed to be an app where artists and readers can express themselves freely, there was no prejudice about authors who wrote about LGBTQ characters, and readers interacted kindly in the comment section. Now some of my favorite WEBTOONs such as Obnoxious Hero-Kun and Valentine can no longer update due to the new policy, and that is basically just like an elephant dart to the progress and acceptance of LGBTQ people. Good Job WEBTOON. :(\n-\u2744\ufe0fshellecat\ud83d\ude3c","2424":"I\u2019ve been using webtoon for almost 5 years now and have read more then 100 stories, but recently they have put a policy on anything even the tiniest bit sexual to be removed and or banned; in hopes to make people who are not mature enough to fathom the concept of sex happy. This is unfair to creators and to loyal webtoon enthusiasts because what defines immature content can be totally biased. I really hope you will reconsider this policy.\nSincerely, a community","2425":"I\u2019m rating this three stars because of the new policy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this app! And for those reluctant of getting it, don\u2019t be! It\u2019s a great app BUTTT The new policy is ticking me off. As in the no NSFW, even if the webtoon is flagged for 19 and older. A lot of stories include NSFW in it so it can really affect a lot of authors. I hope webtoons can find another way around this issue because a lot of authors are devastated. Thanks!","2426":"If your a comic fan or a manga fan you'll love this app, it has a variety of great comics that any character mix nerd would love with great genres like fantasy and sci-fi, romance too. My favorites are nano list,\nUnordinary and charisma.\nIf you love reading comics manga or graphic novels get this app.\nAnd the best part about the app is it's free.","2427":"I think if there's an overwhelming amount of 5 stars you probably have a good idea by now that this app is pretty awesome. There's nothing left to say that hasn't been said. I truly think this is a great app for comic and graphic novel lovers.","2428":"I absolutely love this!!!! When I\u2019m sitting around bored having zero else to do, I know this is gonna be here to keep me occupied. This app probably SAVED MY LIFE on three different occasions\u2014-I didn\u2019t even know it existed a month ago now I don\u2019t know how I went is long without it.","2429":"The original WEBTOON layout was much simpler, a lot more user friendly. So far in the span of ten minutes i have clicked on the wrong tab seven times to attempt to read my daily webtoons. This isn\u2019t very new-user friendly","2430":"if i could give zero stars i would. y\u2019all ruined wattpad and i\u2019m fed up. you need to not remove explicit content. plus ppl can\u2019t even cuss without y\u2019all taking it down, even if it wasn\u2019t rude! wattpad isn\u2019t for kids. nobody makes content for kids. just go to the mf public library if you want kids books. wattpad isn\u2019t for all that. don\u2019t ruin the app. y\u2019all already ruined it with premium and the ads. y\u2019all are so dumb tbh fix this before you lose a bunch of users.","2431":"I did the daily check in thing \u201c5 day survival\u201d I believe and it told me I needed to updated it to the latest app version I pressed it but now it took my coins and I can\u2019t find them but overall the app is great and has a lot of talented artist and comics so do check it out!","2432":"I absolutely would not pay for fast pass due to the fact that the app will randomly delete your account. I have already two separate occasions had to remake accounts because \u201cthe email I had entered is not registered\u201d even though the information was saved into my phone. Just don\u2019t expect your money to be refunded or your subscriptions to still be there.","2433":"I really do enjoy Webtoon, it has many comics I love reading these comics but the app it\u2019s self has been failing a lot lately. The program crashes all the time so I can\u2019t read one comic page without it crashing once or twice and it\u2019s just super buggy now. There\u2019s also the fast pass system which is pretty flawed in its own ways too.","2434":"Enjoyed some of the stories and bought some coins to read more. Then the app updated and now the coins that I bought earlier in the month are gone. Guess I\u2019m not buying coins anymore I\u2019ll just wait for things to unlock because I don\u2019t like having to repay for something I already purchased.","2435":"The reasons for the 4 star is because I can\u2019t access three of my webtoons no matter how long I wait.\nAlso the late updates, the app is almost always telling me something updated like three days ago!\n Please fix these problems Thank you","2436":"I love the app and story\u2019s that artist have provides over the years but daily pass just is in the way most people like rereading story\u2019s they already read but when you try to do that now daily pass just stops it and then you would have to pay \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffd","2437":"I overall love the app since I gave it 5 stars. But I just don't like it when it leaves off in a cliffhanger, like in Freaking Romance. It gives me tense whenever I have to wait for the next chapter. But overall, love the app. \nArigatou for reading my review\/comment ^w^","2438":"I have frequently bought coins to support the authors of these amazing webtoons. I\u2019ve been trying to work with the company for over 2 weeks now when they deactivated my account and took $10 worth of coins with it. As much as I want to support this platform for artists, DO NOT PURCHASE COINS. They customer service has been completely unresponsive with automated responses and has been a struggle to deal with. Learned my lesson.","2439":"Ok let me get to the point ok the comics are free to read but everything else is required to sign up but every time I put a different new password it is not allowed and every time I press \u201cuse a strong password\u201d it doesn\u2019t do anything (I don\u2019t know if that is my device or the app) but I do like the story\u2019s but I don\u2019t know if the app is acting up because it\u2019s not letting me sigh up or it\u2019s just my device","2440":"I\u2019ve recently ran into an issue where the app will crash. Or when I go to open it it\u2019ll close right away. Not sure what\u2019s causing this to happen but it\u2019s kinda annoying. Otherwise I love the app and comics. So if there is a way to resolve this problem please let me know?","2441":"I love the comics on here. I\u2019ve felt happy emotions that I haven\u2019t felt since high school. \n\nBut now the app is limiting our viewing unless we pay money. People loved this app because of the vast creations and we could view our favorite stories whenever we needed a pick me up. \n\n5 stars is what this app had before this rule. And it will be 5 stars again if they allow their viewers to free read again.","2442":"I really like WEBTOON because all the stories are free! The slight problem is the daily pass. Because of this update it takes me AT LEAST 5 months to finish something that\u2019s already completed! \n\nP.S. WEBTOON isn\u2019t working anymore for some reason...don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because my WiFi or because of the new update.","2443":"I love this app, but while I was reading something it said I had to buy 5 coins or wait 5 days, which personally I don\u2019t want to buy 5 coins and I think 5 days is a little too long of a wait. But I love everything else about it! :) Do you mind bringing down the wait time?","2444":"I have had webtoon since the beginning, and now that people can get early access to the chapters I feel like it has taken away from some parts of the app. I am happy that the writers are being payed, but I feel that there should be a different way to do that. I like the reading and the set up, but I hate the early access aspect.","2445":"i just want to start off with i love webtoon but i do not know how to get a fast pass rebate like what do they mean about a WEBTOON account like i think i have one is the account like you have your email on it so you can subscribe it ?plz help me what do it mean.","2446":"my webtoon app was being extremely slow , so i went to go update because i thought; \u201cmaybe it needs an update?\u201d. now it\u2019s even worse. the stories i click on don\u2019t load (and if they do it takes 6+ minutes), i can\u2019t access \/ view my coins and see how much i have left, i can\u2019t click on subscribed stories or my comments. it\u2019s a bit frustrating (i\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fixed asap) but overall the app is really great, it has many amazing authors and artists on here. there\u2019s a category for any type of genre you\u2019re into (:","2447":"This is a great app. I recommend checking out Castle Swimmer, I really liked it. A part I really liked is that it\u2019s FREE! I\u2019m so happy! There are lots of great apps out there that cost money, or require a subscription. WebToon is a great app, and you should definitely check it out. \ud83d\ude01","2448":"This app was my absolutely favorite and it still is. I never had any problems with it for years. I did have it once but it\u2019s fixed now. Thank you so much for creating an app I enjoy so much!","2449":"There\u2019s some serious login issue going on right now... been super into webtoon for years but today i tried to login and it doesn\u2019t recognize my email when i had my login information saved into autocomplete so i know it\u2019s right. apparently other people are having the same problem so please fix this!!!","2450":"I have NEVER had an issue with this app and I love all the stories that I follow and read every week. Then these last couple days after the new update NOTHING will load. I can see that there\u2019s new uploads of stories I follow but once I click on them nothing loads. I have full service AND full WiFi so I know that it\u2019s definitely not my connection. If the update didn\u2019t mess up the app then I\u2019d rate the app as five stars.","2451":"This app is great but it would be even better if you could make comics using a mobile device,I have always wanted to make a comic on webtoon but I can\u2019t because it won\u2019t let me use a mobile device :(","2452":"When I downloaded this app I was kinda skeptical. But when I started reading, and got really into it. This app is freaking amazing and I honestly thing that this is one of the best apps I\u2019ve downloaded. If you see an add for this, don\u2019t hesitate to download.","2453":"I fell in love with this app when I first got it. I loved everything about it, it had all of my favorite genres. I love to read all of the romance and heartwarming things. I actually started to sob on one, um, yeah we don\u2019t talk about that time. Anyways, I give this app a \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f ! \u2764\ufe0f","2454":"This is the kind of app you will have for years! No need to pay to read can fast pass if you want to but they update the comic soon unlike other apps this app is the most unique one so far.","2455":"Why do you have to make people wait for weeks to see the next episode when the comic is done, can\u2019t you add adds instead of people paying for episode bust to be only option. The art is absolutely beautiful, as well as the story line but it makes me so frustrated that you have to wait for so long. You can do better WEBTOON...","2456":"It\u2019s come to my attention that almost past every series I read up to like 35 episode you have to pay or wait seven days are you kidding me!!!! If you buy coins 5 coins per ep is like a lot. Almost each episode is short so the max I\u2019ve seen you can buy is 80 coins so that\u2019s not a lot of episodes you can buy. Just pointing it out.","2457":"I have no idea if anyone else is having this problem, but I\u2019m trying to make an account and I\u2019m not getting confirmation emails? And it\u2019s not me, I know I typed in my email right, and I never got one. There\u2019s no way to re-send the email, and it\u2019s bothering me since I\u2019d love to have an account on here. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know.","2458":"Honestly I love the webtoons. Good quality and amazing stories. There is just one problem. It doesn\u2019t give you an option to post a comic if it\u2019s on a phone. You have to do it on a laptop\/tablet\/ or computer of some sort. But besides that honest really great.","2459":"I really do love this app with all my heart but can you guys please make a night mode like change the white background to black with night mode so people can read at night without blinding themselves and stuff","2460":"I love the app a lot but I can\u2019t seem to make a account. When ever I try to make one it keeps on telling me that my email is wrong, I have tried multiple emails, and none have let me make a account. Please let me know if it\u2019s me or if other people have experience this problem before.","2461":"I 100% love this app I use it everyday and love it so much. But the one thing I don\u2019t really like is that they have a limit to how many stores you can read like you can\u2019t read more then 300 but still I highly recommended this to everyone.","2462":"I love this just two things \n1. Sometimes the screen goes black and exits me out of the app \n2. Can there be another way to get coins because not everyone is going to pay just to get coins \nAnd there are  barely any ads\ud83d\ude03","2463":"I stayed up till\u2019 2 in the morning reading True Beauty and it\u2019s mostly because I feel in love with the humor and characters and I hope others feel the same way but when other stories use sound I can\u2019t hear it \ud83d\ude2d","2464":"I love WEBTOON and my mom said I can\u2019t have any books from the library so no there is this app I be on my phone a lot so I can read books plus I love comic and my friends too I told then to download it and they love it and they think is great and interesting","2465":"Webtoons is an amazing app! You get thousands of free comics that are updated daily\/weekly. Its not like lezhin where you get like two free chapters and then you have to pay, IT COMPLETELY FREE! The only thing that was a minus for me was that there was no YAOI!\ud83d\ude2d I am a major fujoshi and the main manga i read are yaois. Even so, this app is awesome cause it also lets people post their own comics!","2466":"I love this app. It\u2019s everything. My ABSOLUTE favorite comic is Down to Earth by PookieSenpai. It\u2019s so cute. She doesn\u2019t update as often as other authors, but her comic is my favorite. Please! Please! Please! Feature her. She will update more often and I recommend the app and that comic to my friends.","2467":"I've only recently started using the app, but so far I really enjoy the app. I love how it gives us, a variety of different genres we can choose from and how it is completely free with no ads! This app is amazing and I truly enjoy it.","2468":"I heard about this app in a promo video from my favorite youtuber Heavenly Controller. Coming from an avid anime watcher who never really considered reading manga this app makes it extremely entertaining. Whenever I have some free time I'm on this app. Definitely worth your time if your into anime.","2469":"I love this app! My ultimate stress reliever haha. I like how it gives a chance to read comics for free, and the comics are all high quality. I recommend this to anyone! I have already recommended this to my friends. Thank you Webtoon creators, staff, and webtoon writers and illustrators!","2470":"Great interface! Though I liked it 3 versions ago this is great! Awesomazing! I highly recommend unordinary, boyfriend of the dead, my ganders girlfriend, a budgies life, let\u2019s play, soara academy, yandere dead, mushroom movie, my pet succubus, my succubus girlfriend, crawling dreams, winter moon, zone tan adventures & more! I love the search bar! Download it already!","2471":"Would be 5 star if it weren\u2019t for the daily pass only lasting 14 days. I would understand if you unlocked one episode every day and kept it forever but if you want to go back and read episode 11 to look at something you have to waste a days espisode.","2472":"Ok so this is one of the best things that has happened to me in my whole life. It\u2019s all free. I LOVE art and every story here is beautiful. All the people that post their stories are so creative and talented. It amazes me. I mean I just want to say thank you creators for making this app, I actually love you.","2473":"I love Webtoon! I get to read what I subscribe to, and there are amazing comics that I get to read everyday. The only thing that I wish could be different is very minor; it\u2019s that I can only subscribe to 100 comics. That sounds like a lot but like I said there are so many amazing comics.","2474":"You can read them all day but the writer has a Certain part where they stop and they also upload on certain day like some post on Friday and there are all different genres of the stories \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude06","2475":"Such a wonderful app! I read all my favorite webtoons through it. So simple and user friendly. I like how it bookmarks the episode you were reading, and how you can download episodes to read when offline. If you love reading, get this app NOW.","2476":"I love this app!! When I get bored a flip on the app and read a new comic. So many different stories that will make you smile, laugh, cry, yell, and just be happy. You can find the perfect comic everyday so when you wake up the comic is waiting for you to read. Love this app\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","2477":"I absolutely adore Webtoons. The app is absolutely free with no tricks or annoying ads. The entire community is incredible. I have read Webtoons that have made a huge impact on my life. I have and will continue to recommend this app to all of my friends.","2478":"The app shuts down and closes itself while I\u2019m reading. This didn\u2019t happen before, but now I can\u2019t get even through one chapter without the screen turning black and taking it back to my Home Screen. I just started reading a new WEBTOON and it was getting really good, so I hope this glitch gets fixed soon.","2479":"I\u2019m so sorry to say this because besides this incident I was a fan of both webtoons and Wattpad... but since webtoons\u2019s company has bought Wattpad they\u2019re changing the content and taking out a bunch of my favorite chapters\/stories for being adult content which means I\u2019m going to lose my comping mechanism of re reading those stories on Wattpad. I hope webtoons realizes how bad of a decision this is business wise. The only reason the app is even popular is due to the adult content on the app.","2480":"Love WEBTOON and all of the amazing stories but the only draw back that if you get a new phone it doesn\u2019t save the chapters you were on. Sometimes I like to wait awhile so I can binge read a series and I can\u2019t always remember what chapter I\u2019m on. But other than that I love it!","2481":"I didn\u2019t update the app and lost all the coins I paid for! (When I updated before, I still had my coins and history.) I just updated the app and logged back in, but I still don\u2019t see my coins. The series I subscribed to are still saved though.\n\nI still had over 100 coins left\ud83d\ude21\n\nSadly, this was my favorite app, especially since they help and promote the creators. I\u2019m very disappointed that they just took my money away.","2482":"I love love, love  this game and I think there should be a story teller mode to listen to maybe if you cooking or cleaning or doing something in general I think it would be great I idea anyone to any body reading this the app is great except I don\u2019t give anyone 5s -unknown user","2483":"Why is do you have to pay for everything suddenly?? I wanted to read the webtoon Refund High School again cause I never got to finish it even though it\u2019s a finished webtoon you have to pay to read it now??? What?? This is so stupid! I liked webtoon cause you didn\u2019t have to pay for anything but now it\u2019s just you gotta pay for everything!","2484":"The daily pass situation is genuinely terrible. I understand companies like this have to make money but daily pass is definitely not the way to do it. I occasionally pay for fast passes and things like that but going back to completed webtoons was something that I enjoyed a lot. I\u2019m planning on completing the current comics I\u2019m reading and then deactivating webtoons and following the creators on their personal sites instead.","2485":"I love the app and I recently am very fond of The Wolf & Red Riding Hood. Now all of a sudden we need a daily pass to read what was originally free and I just want to read! Also another flaw I am having is I am coming up on my second time trying to confirm my account and it just won\u2019t work!! I love this app but please make it go back to normal I loved it like that!!","2486":"This was one of my favorite apps, it was free, and there were a good amount of comics to read, but now with this stupid daily view thing you can only read 2 comics a day of comics you\u2019ve already read. Noblesse is one fo my favorites and I love to re-read it but now with that stupid daily pass I can\u2019t. Would\u2019ve been 5 stars if they didn\u2019t add on that daily pass","2487":"I\u2019m a creator here and have my stories. I recently deleted my other email but the website nor the phone mode, won\u2019t let me change. It doesn\u2019t have that option. I can\u2019t even switch logging in with social media instead. I even contact webtoons days ago and haven\u2019t gotten a response back. Ugh, this is so frustrating me. \n\nPlease, I need help. Someone help me. ;3;","2488":"It\u2019s good to read high fantasy but sometimes there\u2019s always a problem, I have ads to use to unlock episodes and most of them say SORRY TRY AGAIN LATER so please creators of webtoon fix this.","2489":"I love this app. I\u2019ve put money into some of the stories, which are awesome. However, it\u2019s become super buggy lately and keeps crashing. It won\u2019t open some of the stories, the screen just freezes. I hope it gets fixed soon, because I really love it.","2490":"A\nSo I do my art on my iPad, and was thinking of uploading a series. So I went to the help center thing, and it says that only PC can upload comics and stuff. It would be nice for this app to accept WEBTOONs from all devices, cause I ain\u2019t got the money to just go out and buy a new computer","2491":"Lately when I try to open Webtoon it\u2019ll freeze on me and I cannot read any of the comics I\u2019ve saved. This has been going on for almost a week now and I\u2019ve even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I still get notifications but no matter how many times I open the app it freezes. I\u2019ve been using Webtoon for 1\/2 a year by now and this is the first time I\u2019ve experienced these problems.","2492":"So I really love the books that WEBTOON has to offer but I\u2019m really upset with the lack of minority presence in most of the books especially to black readers. As a person of color I would really like to see some illustrations cater to the minority. Some rare books that you have in your library actually have a lead minority and not to mention a GREAT plot! Just a suggestion. Thanks!","2493":"I can\u2019t find the webtoon canvas app I would like to create a because I have been inspired by the people who create the webtoons my only problem is I can\u2019t seem to find where you can make them and then when I ask for help all it says I\u2019d go to the canvas app and I can\u2019t find the canvas app","2494":"I\u2019ve had webtoon before but then I had a new phone and I tried to download it back but I forgot what it was called. I\u2019m happy I found it again. I have to problems with this app I am so happy that it has became to successful","2495":"I love this app, but when I buy coins I have to get my parents approval. When I send the request to their phone, it won\u2019t load so it can\u2019t get approved and I can\u2019t purchase the coins. It is very annoying and I would appreciate if it was fixed.","2496":"Yes, i do! I love the fact that you don\u2019t have to stick with one thing, you can choose different things to read. Speaking of things to read, the comics in there are amazing, so well written and full of suspense. This is my favorite app.","2497":"Most of the story\u2019s are good at best if you\u2019re looking for amazing reads I\u2019d buy a real manga but this is okay for just wasting time personally interface is okay could be better but it\u2019s not to complicated which is nice \nMy biggest issue if ever now and again it signs me out which is extremely annoying so if that gets fixed I\u2019d rate it higher because theirs nothing I dislike more then inconvenience","2498":"Ok so I had this for a year now and it great but I feel like you can\u2019t get any free coin cause all the challenges feel like they are cheating me so can you please make the challenges longer or different cause when I complete them I don\u2019t get coins.","2499":"I noticed while reading a webtoon that it sounded like a fast forward audio was playing? of people talking??? This webtoon that I was reading had no audio option and i also noticed that my speakers were cutting it and out with white noise. It become unsettling when I thought I heard someone cough or laugh? Needless to say, I\u2019m terrified of opening the app because generally audio with a webtoon is music not mumbles of people talking.","2500":"All in all a stand up app wouldn\u2019t change much for the world, however, for the past couple of days the app has been telling me that I lack an internet connection though I\u2019m connected to WiFi; please fix and thank you ahead of time.","2501":"This app is amazing! But I try to make an account but when I put my email and password it says my email is wrong. And I always check to make sure I got the email correct. WEBTOON I need help with this. Please respond as fast as you can.","2502":"I really love the app! The fact that you can view comics with having to pay is great. Although, it would be nice if the email\/username could be changed. I have an old email on there and I\u2019d like to add my new one but sadly I can\u2019t. I would really love if this feature could be added. Thanks!","2503":"L like how you could just tap to scroll down why remove it now it just makes reading things wierd however this is a good app i love it the only oyher thing i dont like is how long it takes for some episodes to come out but thats not your fault.","2504":"I can honestly say that this app is my absolute FAVORITE APP EVER. I have never experienced bugs or viruses, and the stories are AMAZING!! If you get this app (and you definitely should) don\u2019t forget to check out Sirens Lament and UNordinary! They are literally the best and they have my DYING!","2505":"I just have one problem. Since my phone\u2019s setting is in Chinese and the webtoon\u2019s language is in English, I cannot see some of the texts when a notification pops up in the app. If you could fix that, that\u2019ll be great.","2506":"Everything about this app is great but on mine the screen will randomly freeze. I have tried uninstalling the app then downloading it back but nothing seems to be working.","2507":"WEBTOON is the best ever since I got it I can\u2019t stop using it and reading new comics it\u2019s awesome I love ittttttt plus there are comics that you can read daily and some post a new episode every day it\u2019s awesome and I love how you don\u2019t have to pay for any webtoon thank you webtoon for giving us this amazing APP","2508":"Many writers started storylines that were intended to progress a certain way, and are now unable to, leaving both writers and readers at a loss.\n\nMany writers are planning on making Patreon there full, and only content provider, which as some of so may know, only lets you view content with a subscription.\n\nKeeping this change that limits readers and writers imaginations to your excessive policy\u2019s is only going to lose publicity for your app. I will no longer suggest this app, and with many writers sticking to their hearts and finishing their stories, and with many readers no longer able to access their favorite webtoon, who\u2019s left? \n\nBecause as of now, it\u2019s a fraction of what your writers and readers were, and could have progressed to.","2509":"I love webtoon, but the problem is the policy, this policy has affected most of the comics, we read because we know what the comic is about and we read because we WANT to, And we can\u2019t read with your policy having a big effect on most of the stories, that\u2019s why I think you should let the writers, write their stories the way they have planned","2510":"See i love webtoon its just i really dont like the new policy. It was fine before but now so many of the webtoons we read have changed and its sort of not far to us. Not only is it not far to us readers its not far to the authors. Now they have to go back to all their webtoons. Make sure they apply to their webtoons so they don\u2019t get taken down. So sorry but for right now webtoon does not deserve the five stars if this issue gets fixed it will definitely deserve it.","2511":"I haven\u2019t tried any other apps like this before so I have nothing to compare it to, but I don\u2019t have one bad thing to say about this app so that\u2019s good right? I\u2019ve read some pretty good web comics here and I love it. Awesome. Give it a try.","2512":"Fantastic app, with great user experience overall. Everything is seamless, and stories are fun to read. If you\u2019re looking for amateur artworks, Discover is where you should look at - a lot of talented artists out there indeed!","2513":"There are only a few adds but they never get in the way. You don\u2019t have to pay to do anything. But sometimes (i dont know if it\u2019s just because of my phone) the app just glitches and kicks me off","2514":"This app is terrific so many people can write\/draw about their stories in such a creative and captivating way! Also the people on this app are also amazing they support so many people! I am thankful for this app, you should totally consider downloading it! :)","2515":"Great app for story\u2019s making story\u2019s yknow the deal... it\u2019s the ads I\u2019m not getting notifications for the ad locked episodes and when I do try to watch a ad to unlock it , it simply won\u2019t work and this has been going on for days with many others","2516":"Are you going to make it to were we can search something like for example, \u201cwolfs\u201d and have it come up with all the story\u2019s that have like wolves or something like that because i love reading things like that","2517":"Personally in my opinion I think webtoons is a great place to read comics but, why use Fast Pass when you can literally read whole webtoon comic without it? I mean I have to wait a whole entire 19 minutes or wait until I get coins just to get to one episode.","2518":"Okay so this app is so much fun and it has many many stories that u just get so addicted to. No ads just patients is needed\ud83d\ude02 but one thing I hate is not having enough coins like yeah I can get 10 coins for .99 but that\u2019s only 2 episodes... like make more available events to get more coins or lower the coin prices on each episode.","2519":"Used to love webtoons and wanting to go back and binge a completed series only for it to be locked behind a paywall. Why would I spend money to read a series that I already completed before when it was still free? I think this daily pass idea is ridiculous and a waste of time. I don\u2019t feel like reading like 3 chapters a day only to get invest in the story and realize I can\u2019t continue until the next day or having to pay.","2520":"Hi! So I would recommend webtoon if u love reading for making comics, but one problem that I have is that the ad thing. Whenever I press ok to see the ad so I could move on to the next episode, it won\u2019t load. I would very much appreciate it if you could fix this. Otherwise it\u2019s amazing!","2521":"I have never in my life been into reading but thanks to this app I love reading its stupidly cool books. I just wanna keep reading I like the freaking romance, down to earth, unordinary, blue chair, and rebirth those are my favorites and suggestions so if you wanna get this app GET IT! It is amazing!","2522":"so they decided to add something now where any completed series needs coins to access more than two episodes and that\u2019s for every series and every day. WEBTOON THIS DOES NOT MAKE ME WANT TO COME BACK EVERY DAY TO FINISH THE COMPLETED SHOW IT JUST MAKES ME WANT TO LEAVE YOUR APP FOR A NEW ONE. so consider this annoyance before downloading this app. other than that the app is perfect which is why i have it 3 stars","2523":"I love the app and have used it for a long time, but all of a sudden, the app when I tap it crashes. My other apps are working completely fine, so I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened or why. I saw bug fixes were made yesterday, but now, well, I\u2019m stuck without being able to open the app!","2524":"I think this app would be perfect if it saved on what chapter you left on when you use the app on another device, if this can be made possible, I am perfectly satisfied.","2525":"I love this app! I read comics to sleep lol (mostly bl tehe) but why POLICY WHYYY it makes it difficult for artists to upload there art and have to put it on tapas and some people can\u2019t ;-; I\u2019m gonna cry why not just take it oof and you\u2019ll get better reviews you know-","2526":"I actually love this app and all the different comics you can read on here! I\u2019m always dying to watch the next episodes every time I read a new one <3. Hehe thank you to all the WEBTOON artists, you sure are amazing at what you do ;))).","2527":"This app is awesome! The creators are talented!\nThe stories are perfectly written! Great community, but some 18+ other than that it a great place with interesting stories full of action, romance, horror and other categories! I prefer romance \u2022w\u2022\nIf I could, I would recommend gourmet hound, zero game and lore Olympus","2528":"I love Webtoon and many of its creators and stories, but recently, whenever I try to open the app, it crashes, and won\u2019t even load past the Webtoon logo screen. I don\u2019t know if this is just my phone or if it\u2019s widespread, but if it is the latter, it would be much appreciated if you could fix the issue. Thanks so much!","2529":"I mean this app is amazing and i love almost all of the stories and they have so much to offer but my app isn't opening up and just glitches out and i have restarted my phone 3 times and deleted the app i love this app greatly.","2530":"Look it\u2019s a great app with great content and an awesome community but your app is so slow I mean it takes so long for anything to load just recently I had to delete the app and had to download it again to see if that would fix seriously fix it for the love of holy","2531":"Soooo I love Webtoons a lot! The creators and the options you have are endless and practically unique! However this recent update is completely bugging out on my phone causing me to not be able to read those amazing comics that I love \ud83d\ude2d I uninstalled it to reinstall it and it\u2019s still bugging out and not working fluently...","2532":"So I love this app but I want to make an account on my phone but how ever hard I try it never sends the email so I can make an a account and I know your say oh just keep reading with out an account but I want to make stories! So if someone could help me that would be great thank you","2533":"I\u2019ve been using this app for well over a year, and I can truthfully say that it\u2019s been one of my favorite apps since I first got it. The stories are very intriguing and well illustrated with multiple different genres and art styles.","2534":"It\u2019s a nice app and easy to scroll through but recently my app has been crashing and I have a XR so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my phones fault I hope that gets fixed soon and I also wish there was a way to earn coins free rather then you have to pay..","2535":"They advertise on their website that you can read 3 new episodes if you download the app, so I did. What they didn\u2019t advertise is that you have to purchase coins to unlock those episodes. I understand why they do that system, I just wish they\u2019d be upfront about it costing you actual money to read ahead.","2536":"I\u2019ve been reading WEBTOON for years and have loved every bit of it. But this past month, there\u2019s been an ad pop up (for Starr Insurance Company) that takes up half the screen. There\u2019s no \u2018x\u2019 and the only way to close it is to close the app. It\u2019s very frustrating and has been happening more and more frequently.","2537":"I love the animation and how the story\u2019s go i like to make books in my free time of course not official books just paper books and this gives me so many iDisk like i made a book called the killer animal all thanks to webtoon this app is great i strongly recommend it","2538":"I like it I fell in love with the art plus you ca also publish your own comic but one thing is that some comics have fast passes which is where you buy coins so you don\u2019t have to wait for the next up day","2539":"The comics you read are good and enjoyable. However, it says \u2018in app purchases\u2019 but that\u2019s supposed to mean you have a choice. No. When reading comics right away it takes money. And a few days later it says to go to a link to finalize payments when I didn\u2019t know I had any. Be aware of this before you get the app","2540":"I love webtoons but the new policy not only takes a lot of the excitement out of reading but it also limits the authors form expressing their creativity. If you have to, make it so there\u2019s an adult (18+) section. It\u2019s not fair to your loyal supporters to just cut out the good stuff completely. Please change the policy \ud83d\ude2d","2541":"It is a very nice app and the stories are great but sometimes the writers of the stories take breaks out of no where and it\u2019s a little annoying like they say I\u2019ll be back in a week and they\u2019ll be back in 2 months and when they do come back it\u2019s a short story. It would be fine if they came out with more than on","2542":"Get this app it is amazing. I love this app so much the only thing I don\u2019t like is when my fav WEBTOONs go on huits or however you spell it but still and the way My Boo ended I loved it sooo much but then all of a sudden it ended and I\u2019m still sad about it.","2543":"I\u2019ve had this app for some time now and am really enjoying it! The best thing by far is the stories witch are amazing and you don\u2019t have to pay for anything! 10\/10 would recommend!","2544":"This app is really fun because you get to read a whole bunch of different stories from authors. Some of the stories are really funny, aka WINTER MOON, and then some of the stories are really romantic, aka MAGE AND DEMON QUEEN and GHOST WIFE. I really love this app it\u2019s very calm and relaxing and I love going on it everyday seeing the new stories authors post.","2545":"I seriously love this app! However I have a question!! When u went onto webtoon it logged me out for some strange reason and I don\u2019t know my password. Also when I searched up \u201cwebtoon\u201d on the App Store it didn\u2019t show.","2546":"I love webtoon but the NeW uPdAte is terrible. The authors of these amazing stories don't know what to do because of the new update. Some are having to end their stories because of it. Most of them clearly state that their webtoon is +18 so there shouldn't be a problem if theyre warning us. I just feel that webtoon should find way to allow these artists to still create their comics without worrying about a new update causing their creative unique comics to be banned.","2547":"This app has quickly become addictive and I\u2019m sooo glad I got it! I do wish that I could use it away from WiFi and not have it lag but that is the only thing I would change about it!","2548":"I absolutely love this app. It allows you to easily access different mangas based on genres. I love how it keeps up with what you've read and what has new chapters. I've found some wonderful mangas that I wish were anime. I'd totally watch them. Totally love it. My favorites are My Dear Cold-Blooded King, I Love Yoo, Sub Zero, My Boo and Let's Play. \u263a\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udc95\n-EuphemiaEclair","2549":"This app is great ,, there\u2019s tons of comics with great storylines and I love it but where in the WORLD did the feature where you can tap at the bottom of the screen to scroll down go , after I updated the app  it was gone and it\u2019s so annoying to not have it (not that\u2019s its a huge issue but it\u2019s kinda annoying)","2550":"Enjoyed by like minded kind people who share a supportive community and be able to show just amazing a diverse stories.\n\nIt\u2019s an online living breathing book store with thousands of options \n\nSo choose your journey","2551":"WEBTOON OMG is the app to go. It\u2019s very addicting it\u2019s amazing and it\u2019s very fun. My friend introduced me to WEBTOON and I was like what is this then when I started reading my romance comics I was blown away. I love how you can download you episodes so you can watch it later. Get this app and you won\u2019t regret it. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe","2552":"I really love this app but a suggestion that I would like on the app is a place where when we finished a webtoon, there would be a finished webtoons place where all the webtoons we finished would be. So that I can see how many webtoons I\u2019ve finished. But overall it\u2019s a great app that I enjoy a lot. :)","2553":"This app has something for everyone, and it works out super well. I have been using this app for several years and have had no problems. I completely recommend.","2554":"This app is absolutely amazing. I love how there are so many different stories to choose from! There are many different genres too. You are into horror? There is horror! You into romance? There is tonnns of romance stories. I recommend this app to anyone who loves to read.","2555":"I love everything about webtune I love the books please just add something i have a  book that has a lot of chapters and I really want to read it  on webtune  please just add a scanner and then you scan the book I really wanna make it out of episodes in  webtune please just add this thank u","2556":"I really really love webtoon. I love the stories, the creators, the art, etc. It's such a beautiful app. Well it was. Recently an update made it impossible to binge our favorite completed stories, instead making it only 3 episodes at a time. It's truly heartbreaking to see such an amazing app do this to its viewers. I still love Webtoon but I unfortunately can't use the app anymore. My favorite stories that i've read over and over are now lost.","2557":"Overall it\u2019s a good app. One thing that really bothers me is the coins, i wish you could watch videos to get coins instead of having to buy them, or receive coins by finishing story\u2019s or reading a certain amount of story\u2019s.","2558":"When reading a comic I personally don\u2019t want to read the comments so I thought that if there was a \u201cinfinity reading\u201d setting if you won\u2019t have to stop until the most recent post, it would be easier to enjoy","2559":"I loved the app but then the fast\/daily pass came along. It\u2019s soo frustrating because it takes about 2 months to read an already finished WEBTOON. And I bet I\u2019m not the only one who hates this so if you could take off the fast pass l\/ daily pass that would be awesome.","2560":"Listen I love webtoon and I always have. But I\u2019m having problems with the app and it\u2019s only this app that\u2019s doing it. Every time I open the app it shuts me right back out. Do you guys maybe have a way for me to Fix this I\u2019ve tried redownloding it and that didn\u2019t work .","2561":"I love the storyline of the each stories but I got on the app after some time and it kept crashing on my device. I\u2019m an IOS user and I wonder if it\u2019s because of the app itself or just my phone? But I hope nobody else is experiencing this also","2562":"I very much enjoy WEBTOON but my only major problem with it is that they don\u2019t have some sort of dark mode so my eyes don\u2019t hurt when I\u2019m reading at like 12 at night. Other than that it\u2019s a great app I recommend highly, god of high school is rally good if your just getting started.","2563":"I haven\u2019t seen anything on this yet but I love WEBTOON it has so many good stories and it\u2019s a wonderful place but for the past month I can\u2019t read anything without it pausing and then kicking me out after like a minute, is this something with my device or is it the app??","2564":"5 days ago WEBTOON started acting up saying that some series are unavailable and some just being blank. I just found out that there was an update right around when it started acting up. Please fix this so that we can all enjoy our comics whether we have stay at home orders or not. Thank you.","2565":"I love Webtoon I have webtoon from 2 and half years ago but ultimately(from three days ago) I can\u2019t read any Webtoon, the app it\u2019s really bugged, I can\u2019t see any of my comments I can\u2019t do anything. Please fix it\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd","2566":"The app opens but doesn\u2019t load the comics and the screen is frozen too. I hope you are able to fix it and I understand to be patient! Thanks for your hard work!!!","2567":"For some reason it won\u2019t let me read my stories, it\u2019ll let me click on them to go into the episodes but it\u2019ll just be a white screen once I click on it. So I decided I\u2019ll restart my phone, didn\u2019t work. So I deleted the app and reinstalled it, now it won\u2019t let me sign back in. It\u2019ll let me type in my information but it\u2019ll say something like \u201ccant download information\u201d.","2568":"I love this app and it\u2019s stories so much but legitimately almost everytime I open it up I have to wait for it to load after the whole thing freezes up. I have to close out of the app entirely and it\u2019s just a slightly annoying problem.","2569":"I love this app I have a little trouble finding my past stories I used to read or I have trouble finding a good story that I can get into... also I love to draw\/ write things so I want to know how to make a story on there and I\u2019m thinking if I don't know how or I can\u2019t cause I need coins or something I might end up delete ting it","2570":"This app has been short of great, it has a great selection and if you\u2019re patient enough to wait for the weekly updates then it\u2019s perfect, but WEBTOON has started to introduce limits on how many episodes you can catch up on daily (if you open up a new comic, you can only read two episodes a day for free) which might make me give up on this app","2571":"recently (for the last month or so), ads have been popping up on my screen while I read that will not go away unless I close out of the app. they take up approximately half the screen making it incredibly frustrating to read comics. please fix this problem!!","2572":"I absolutely love this app but only just this pst year they started putting out ads at the bottom of the comic. Wasnt a big deal until recently they have almost completely blocked the top fourth of the comic on my phone screen.  I dont mind them at the bottom of the comic but this is just intrusive. I cant go back because the back arrow is behind the ad. Please restrict where your ads go. The app is starting to feel like a boot leg product.","2573":"I love WEBTOON and being able to binge read some of my favorites is nice but with the new waiting period is irritating I just want to binge read and not have to wait so many days to be able to finish a series. I\u2019m all for supporting an artist but there\u2019s nothing say that the money I will spend on coins to read will go to the writer. \n\nOver all it\u2019s a nice app. I\u2019m just disappointed with some aspects of it.","2574":"So the most recent contest of logging in everyday has resulted in continuous glitches for me. I\u2019ve signed on every day since it started, meaning coins should be issued to me yesterday. However, 4 times now it has reset my progress to day one, including wiping away a time I was at day 12. Please fix this error for future contests, as I now no longer even have long enough to get all 15 days in because I was reset again today.","2575":"Daily pass is idiotic and a feature that needs to be removed and never spoken of again. I will not read a story if it has daily pass. I already have to wait for stories to be updated and no your telling me I have to wait to read a COMPLETED story??? You are taking the fun out of reading webtoons and making it more of a hassel. I guarantee that webtoon will be over before you know it","2576":"I was just getting into it but after either the latest or the other update now I can\u2019t read it without spending money on unlocks it. Kinda stupid since it\u2019s already been out awhile and never was like that before. Really hope you will change it back to the way it was","2577":"I love it so much there\u2019s nothing wrong, I just think if the developers can add background downloading for the comics would be pretty cool, I don\u2019t like the fact that I have to actually wait for it downloading on the screen -__- so I rate it a 4 for that reason\ud83d\ude2dfix that and it\u2019ll be a straight 5 Star \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd8b","2578":"This is more of a question, didn\u2019t know where to ask it. Is their a way to further customize what is recommended for you or just completely block all content that you\u2019re not interested in?","2579":"Hands down best I have had this for a little over a year now and I am always on this app  read it everyday it has the best stories and I would recommend you read it it is my absolute favorite comics so far","2580":"I loveeee the creators and the awesome comics they make, but recently the screen freezes whenever I try to scroll down to read. Funny thing is it doesn\u2019t happen right away, it occurs after like 5 mins. Hopefully webtoon can fix that so I can read again    (\u043e\u00b4\u2200`\u043e).","2581":"I love this app but recently it\u2019s refused to let me buy coins-I\u2019ve restarted and reinstalled the app multiple times, submitted the support ticket twice and have yet to hear anything. \nAgain I love the app, but I don\u2019t like waiting weeks to read the episode so I\u2019ll go weeks not looking at the app without this feature","2582":"So I have been using webtoon for about a year and a half and it is part of my daily life. I just updated the app earlier today and now everytime I go into it, it never fully loads then crashes. I waited a few hours, I restarted my phone and like whatever I can do. I haven\u2019t been able to open it yet today and I would like to read the amazing comics on it. So like help???","2583":"I honestly love this app so much but i don\u2019t understand why but everytime I read a chapter of any comic it just starts glitching and it freezes every 3 minutes and it\u2019s kinda bothering me but other then that I love it","2584":"I've read a lot of reviews about the policy, but it doesn't affect me, so I can't write a review about it. \n\nMy problem with it is the 100 Discovery limit. Why is it here? It has no reason and forced me to unsubscribe from a LOT of webtoons. \n\nBut overall, I love this app. I would 10\/10 recommend.","2585":"Why did you have to add a coin payment to read stuff? I know I can wait your whatever for it to be free but I\u2019m not patient. I only can across one story that has it though wonder way the rest them don\u2019t have the coin payment?\ud83e\udd14","2586":"I have been reading webtoon for some time now and gone addicted!! There are really good featured comics that I love along with some discover ones that I hope will someday get featured. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoy reading with a little pizzazz","2587":"I love this app a lot.. but there's just one big problem with it. I can only subscribe to 100 discover webtoons. That just seems stupid to me.. why must there be a limit to how many discover webtoons I can subscribe to?? Please make the limit larger or just remove it all together.","2588":"I love WEBTOON with it\u2019s endless amount of content(most of it amazing) and weirdly great community. But, lately, I\u2019ve been hearing about a new policy on discover which is forcing authors to leave big chunks out of their content, which also might affect their revenue and make their hobby not as enjoyable as they can\u2019t share it like they used to be able to. It\u2019s still a wonderful app, but personally I preferred it before the new policy.","2589":"I love webtoon but I also love the nsfw comics, but since your new policy there is no nsfw. People read at their own risk, and I don\u2019t agree with this policy because it even asks if you\u2019re 19+ or 18+ for some nsfw comics. This also affects creators and some readers might even leave their comic which is bad for the creator just because the comic doesn\u2019t have what they like anymore. I still like webtoon but it was just better before this policy.","2590":"I absolutely loved this platform till the new policy was put to use, it ended up getting rid of my favorite comics on this site and tarnished my idea of WEBTOON! If you read NSFW there was an 18+ listed at the beginning of the story, sometimes every episode... I now will be going to Tapas due to the fact they allow NSFW. They allow all stories. Sad I really loved this app and read it daily much like thousands of people.","2591":"Webtoons rivaled other top free comic sites! But ever since the new update, quality work has been hard to find. Of course, There are exceptions but with the new policy they made for new authors..... let\u2019s just say that it seems like they are just trying to drive them out! Ridiculous to limit an authors freedom so much! Where the incentive for that? Tapas is a better option now.","2592":"This app has helped me a lot! I don\u2019t like to read that much, but when I found this app all I wanted to do was read. I would 10\/10 recommend to people who don\u2019t like to read.","2593":"I saw this in a Facebook add, and I have been slowly reading more and more ever since! \n\nI would LOVE if the app was updated so you could tell which web toons still have unread chapters. That is the only thing that bugs me!","2594":"I LOVE this app! It\u2019s so easy to read through the various WEBTOONs and the stories are so interesting. There is a pretty decent selection of genres too. I use this app literally every day and get so excited for the comic updates that I often lose sleep over it lol.","2595":"I don\u2019t think I would be able to function if webtoon stopped existing, I\u2019m so emotionally invested in way to many different series that I get excited to go to sleep, so I can read my webcomics when I get up in the morning...","2596":"I honestly don\u2019t read a lot of comics, mainly because I could never find comics that I treated me. But when I found webtoon I was opened to a world of fascinating stories and funny relatable comics! This has to be just such a stellar and amazing app! I suggest this to anybody out that that enjoys comics!","2597":"It\u2019s a good app with good content, but I hate that it keeps unsubscribing me to the stories I like. I check back every day for them, then find they\u2019re missing cause I got unsubscribed. I have an account that I\u2019ve had for at least 2 years, but it just keeps happening.","2598":"The books are good but when I try to sign up it blocks out the password part and I can\u2019t type and when it actually works it says mg user name is taken when it\u2019s just a bunch of random numbers there is no way someone has the exact numbers this app is really annoying please fix it","2599":"Heard that webtoon bought out wattpad. It might just be a rumor and not be true, or it might be another company, but either way, they\u2019re trying to make it \u2018kid friendly\u2019 which is kinda disappointing to me. Either way, I don\u2019t really see the point of changing the app and deleting stories when I\u2019m pretty sure the original rating for it was 17+ already. Wattpads definitely gonna lose a lot of support and fans if that happens, including me.","2600":"okay so lets get this straight, i get really annoyed when we cant buy tokens or earn tokens i would be really glad if they add that because we have to wait AGES to read chapters in webtoon, or the thing i want them to do, is make it less than 6 days :\/","2601":"when webtoon bought wattpad they got rid of the smuts. bye everyone\u2019s gonna uninstall and leave bad reviews like me. give the authors back their books at the bare minimum. It\u2019s not their fault! Like in the webtoons there\u2019s also smut so idk why y\u2019all ban it on wattpad. have fun losing users and getting more angry reviews! Love ya! \ud83d\ude0d\u2728\ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98(I gave two stars instead of 1 cos webtoon actually has some decent stories)","2602":"I love WEBTOON. The stories are soo addictive. My problem is that the summer reading programs never work for me. Even if I read like 24 episodes or something, they don\u2019t show up as the right number. So I have to pay for new episodes just to do the summer reading","2603":"I like to binge comics, but webtoon wants to lock completed series (that were previously free) behind a paywall. They started doing this a year ago, but it\u2019s getting more aggressive. It seems every completed series will be put behind a paywall. You can read two measly chapters at a time for free or pay for their currency to unlock, which can be a small fortune and probably far more than you would pay for a digital book copy.","2604":"The WEBTOON app was great until they implemented the daily pass feature. You had access to so many free comics and I didn\u2019t mind the fast pass feature, it made sense. But then they introduced daily pass and now I can\u2019t binge a comic like I used to and it makes me want to delete the app, only two comics that update weekly are stopping me. This feature is stupid and until they remove it the app gets 1 star.","2605":"I used to love this app bc I could read and re-read endlessly, until they added daily pass. I would like to re-read my favorite stories without having to wait as though they were still updating, that\u2019s the main reason why people read finished stories first!","2606":"I am newer to WEBTOON so I don\u2019t mind having to wait or pay for coins on the ongoing stories I like to read. My only issue is the change to the release date with no warning. I get so excited knowing I have four days left and then it\u2019s at seven? Or 14? Why?","2607":"Even though there are warnings I wish they would add explicit content back there are warnings for reasons . Most readers have to go on different apps to read the chapter ,And sometimes creators have to redo a panel just because of the policy . So this is a recommendation to add back explicit content.","2608":"Coins and ads I can understand, but daily pass has been preventing me from reading completed series. It seems like so much effort to finish them by only reading 1 per day, especially for longer series. They could be good for newer Webtoons instead of making us wait a full week for updates, but please please please take them off of completed series.","2609":"I loved this app and spent quite a bit on fast passes because the authors\/artists are just amazing. I would read the weekly updates and then fill in my time with reading the already completed comics. Now you have to pay coins or only read one chapter a day for the completed comics. I think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. It killed the app for me. I\u2019m not going to bother anymore.","2610":"I wanted to read the completed story BASTARD but your making me either pay or wait for a story that\u2019s already been finished. I love this app and all the stories in it but making us wait for a story that\u2019s already been finished has no point","2611":"I love WEBTOON but recently with daily pass every time I want read a completed series I have to wait a day for each episode! That makes me mad. Is it to much to ask that when a author finishes a WEBTOON you don\u2019t have to pay money to read it!? Before daily pass I would buy coins and stuff but now I will not spend anymore money until daily pass and anything like it is gone. I am mad!","2612":"The app continuously crashed out of nowhere while I was reading, so I uninstalled it. Once I reinstalled it and tried to log back in, I come to find out it deleted my account. I\u2019ve used WEBTOON for forever now, and I\u2019m so upset all my chapters and saved WEBTOONs are lost. It says the email I\u2019m trying to use is not registered, but I can pull up my email and see the emails from webtoon notifying me which of my saved webtoons have updated.","2613":"As of today of july 10th i cant open the app for some reason it just crashes immediately after i open it and i dont know why. Could it be because of the ipdates?","2614":"There are a lot of great WEBTOONs and authors on here, but the developers need work. They just had a spring savings event and even when I completed the criteria, it didn\u2019t let me spin for more coins. It happens often too for their coin events, very gimmicky and then don\u2019t deliver. If you use this app, just use the free stuff and don\u2019t waste your money.","2615":"I would give this app a 5-star rating but the waiting time is weird. We should get coins through adds and stuff. Or watch an add for waiting it would be more efficient and people would probably start giving 5-star reviews instead of 4 or 3. Until then my rating stays the same","2616":"I love the webtoon app so very much but the new thing watch a video to get the new ep. is very annoying for me cause it hi work. Many people tell me to update webtoon but i\u2019m at the maximum level for updates rn so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening I would like to read the next ep. of love n life and that awkward magic","2617":"I really enjoy WEBTOON it\u2019s an amazing place to go through time and such. \n\nAlthough something I wish was updated(if it hasn\u2019t been already) i just wish that we would be able to upload to WEBTOON through mobile device\n\nYou see I mainly do all of my art on my mobile device and it would just make it a lot easier for me and other persons if we didn\u2019t have to go through the whole downloading to the pc then publishing \n\nThis of course is just a little nit pick\/ idea","2618":"I love this app, but recently it won\u2019t let me open it. Whenever I try it just crashes. I even deleted it\/redone loaded it and it didn\u2019t work. Please fix this issue because otherwise this is an amazing. Update: this issue is now fixed for me but is still an issue for people I know","2619":"I had encountered some issue in the app while logging in and sent a report and they were so helpful and professional in fixing the issue and gave very quick responses.","2620":"This is a really good app but recently whenever I try to load the app it takes forever to load and then freezes at the home screen. I hope they fix this soon.","2621":"There\u2019s a challenge that appeared for WEBTOON and I participated. It said if you read 100 episodes you get 5 coins. So I completed it and it said I would get them on the 23rd. So I came back and I checked everything but nothing was there, I even checked for an update.","2622":"Love the app the only trouble is when I bought coins. Sent the all the information I could. The continued to ask for more information even though I sent pictures of everything they asked for. In the end never got the coins that I had purchased and never received due to the app malfunction.","2623":"I really like the app there are different stories for everyone but I had to delete and download I hope you can help me but I can\u2019t log in I\u2019m having some trouble so if you see this please help if you can","2624":"I love this app so much, all these creativity and just wonderful stories. \n\nI recently just purchased $16 dollars worth of coins, and they never came in. I wanted to contact support but all they have is the \u201cHelp\u201d in setting which doesn\u2019t really help at all. This is infuriating because all these episodes I wanna read and not have the coins I purchased. :(","2625":"I love this app overall, it's really different and I truly enjoy the stories. I wish there was another way to food to episodes without needing to buy coins from the shop. For example, if you watch some ads you gain coins to use for fast passes.","2626":"This game is super fun sometimes I have trouble but that\u2019s ok I  prefer this game because this other game I had has coins and you have to pay real life money (am not going to say the game because I don\u2019t wanna to be rude) I have to say download this game it\u2019s really fun","2627":"Love the app and been having it for so long but now it\u2019s not loading and saying my network internet connection is garbage and won\u2019t load anything and I tried everything to make it to the point where it should work never had this problem until now what gives","2628":"I absolutely love this app it\u2019s so addictive and nice but I honestly believe it could greatly benefit by implementing a choice for branching stories like the ones where you can choose the path it the character takes or the outcome of the story","2629":"I love reading the comics and this current summer reading is a nice incentive to get plenty of readers to view some great stories. However it's really hard to read when said ad promoting it pops up every 4 seconds.","2630":"I love this app and I thoroughly enjoy many webtoons that have been made but lately, I have noticed that the app decides to freeze while I\u2019m reading. I have restarted my phone and turned off\/on the WiFi as well but nothing seems to be working. Please fix this issue.","2631":"Every time I would tap on an episode and keep scrolling it eventually just freezes and takes you off WEBTOON or just stays there. I would please recommend you fix that please.","2632":"Hi I\u2019m here to object that the new policy should stay cause Maybe someone who likes Anime wants to get webtoon but would if That person was like 7 and she or he shouldn\u2019t be seeing 18+ content because she or he is only A Kid so would if your kid wanted this game and they were only at a kid age!","2633":"I love Webtoon! I love how you can read comics offline and online as well. Except, sometimes, when I scroll through the comics, the whole comic freezes and I can\u2019t do anything. All I have to do is refresh the app. It\u2019s really annoying, please fix this! Thank you.","2634":"I absolutely love this app! I also adore the comics! Such as \u2018my giant nerd boyfriend\u2019 \u2018I love yoo\u2019 \u2018age matters\u2019 \u2018her life from behind the mirror\u2019 \u2018oh! Holy\u2019 \u2018fluffy boyfriend\u2019 \u2018freaking romance\u2019 \u2018subZero\u2019 and finally, \u2018sunny side skies\u2019 I hope that this app does very well with its future! And I will be sure to share it with my friends, keep on doing great!!!","2635":"Dear webtoon I love you but I draw on a iPad and I find it hard to publish on a computer and I think it will be a lot better with being able to publish on a mobile device","2636":"I\u2019m sorry WEBTOON but somehow I can\u2019t sign in, no matter what I do it\u2019s so hard to sign in! I love reading WEBTOON and love this app but I can\u2019t sign in. I know you may think that you can\u2019t help me but I just want WEBTOON to know that I can\u2019t sign in and I am having some problems.","2637":"I love the amazing stories WEBTOON has to offer, but as of recently, WEBTOON is limiting the creativity of the authors\/creators. It has deprived readers of the enjoyment of reading their favorite stories. Because of their new rules, many authors have to change their story. Many are even considering not posting their story on WEBTOON any further. This is a huge blow for WEBTOON and I can only hope for WEBTOON to realize how huge of a mess they have made to their otherwise great app.","2638":"Webtoon is honestly a great app to pass the time with. It\u2019s better than apps that you need to pay for to even watch one episode in my opinion. The quality of the webtoons are fantastic, and the authors themselves are wonderful!","2639":"I downloaded this to read a specific comic cause I like reading different takes on mythology, but now I\u2019m in the middle of about 12 comics because they have some really great artists\/writers on the app\/site. Worth the read!","2640":"Been reading unordinary, tower of god and now I love yoo and the only complaints I have is lack of tool to bookmark a page or scene or even chapter. Maybe i just don\u2019t see how bookmark works, because I try several times and it seems to only work on current chapter?","2641":"I really love this app. I use to be a big reader in middle school and kind of let that go in high school and college. I\u2019m always looking forward to new episodes everyday and every week. Keep up the good work to all the writers and artists on WEBTOON.","2642":"Webtoon has alot of different artist's that have all different types of styles and the web comics I read on webtoon are great quality. Webtoon has a friendly community which makes it awesome to talk to people who like the same web comics as you.\ud83d\ude0a","2643":"Well... Where should I begin, WEBTOON is amazing by making this app inspiring to other readers out there that like comics, Also another thing that I like it how it\u2019s free to read these comic books and how the authors respond to other readers that love there comic books. \n~Emily Bogedain \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf38\u2728\u2728","2644":"I really love webtoon it\u2019s a great app and I read a lot of comics on webtoon but one thing I really hate is the fact that they have a new policy for mature content and it affects a lot of artists and writers and I really hate that so if you can just remove the policy then I\u2019d really like that thank you. :)","2645":"Overall I think this app is alright. We have amazing stories from all sorts of people. Although the APP makes it impossible to look anything up. On the internet I saw a WEBTOON comic and tried to look it up on the actual app but sadly, it didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know why it refuses to work but it doesn\u2019t and needs to be fixed before I ever use the app again. If there is a story you\u2019re dying to read, don\u2019t bother. It will not work.","2646":"I love webtoon and I always have, but in the newest update it got rid of my progress on the webtoons I was reading, even when I\u2019m signed onto my account. When I leave the app all the most recent webtoons I was reading are gone and when I go to them it says I hadn\u2019t even started them. Please fix this problem.","2647":"I love that you guys and girls make comics for people like me so please listen too this request. Could you please add button or switch to turn the home screen back into the old version of the home screen from the last update. Once again I love what you do and I hope I haven't hurt your feelings \nPlease keep up the good work.","2648":"Please change daily pass there\u2019s no point for that daily passes ruins WEBTOON and makes it on fun two completed series I really just want to read it and enjoy reading it instead of waiting a whole day for a completed series please read this","2649":"I\u2019ve had this app for a while now. Great weebtoons, love to explore new content, however I\u2019ve been logged out of WEBTOON for a few times where I had to make new accounts because they didn\u2019t recognize my email I originally had. I lose all of my stuff I had on it, so it\u2019s pretty annoying. Tappytoon\/Tapas doesn\u2019t have this issue but they are expensive.","2650":"Like other reviews said. There\u2019s some old completed webtoons I used to love to re read. Now I have to pay to read more than one a day. Webtoons used to shine because it was the only platform that didn\u2019t force you to pay to read. They just fell into the money trap like any other crappy app now.","2651":"We need more comics with spanking no one writes about it unless it\u2019s just a novel on other apps. like Wattpad it isn\u2019t comics but it\u2019s better to read but I do love WEBTOON it was my first love when it came to reading online. but usually first loves don\u2019t last and even though I still read it is no longer my favorite reading app!","2652":"This app is amazing to use I love reading the comics it really boosts my confidence if your new to creating comic it is a bit difficult to get the hang of it but you can do it!! 10 out of 10 app would recommend","2653":"There has recently been an update and I thought it was great and I tried to click on the stories I was trying to read and enjoy when it suddenly said it had no internet which it did I tried turning my phone on and off but it didn\u2019t work. HELP PLEASE","2654":"There are so many good manhwa that have been completed, but now the daily pass comes and it ruins the availability to read. Many people want to read multiple chapters\/episodes in one sitting not just one or two please remove daily pass for completed series so reader can enjoy those manhwas","2655":"I severely love love this app! It has amazing comics and artists! Probably the best app I\u2019ve ever used!\n\nAlthough for some reason it\u2019s telling me that I have no internet connection, but I actually do. Please help me understand why it\u2019s doing this!!!","2656":"Omg I love this app I\u2019m an 11 year old and I\u2019m obsessed with this app to the point where I want to start making webtoons ive seen k dramas with mostly the main character or main characters best friend doing webtoons it\u2019s awesome can a person this young be a webtoon creator :3","2657":"The app is pretty good! I love to read different types of stories on it! Especially the BLs! :) but it\u2019s been glitching out so I have no idea how to get in the app I\u2019ve restarted my phone and deleted the app and re- downloaded it but it\u2019s glitching out :\/","2658":"Hi I really would like you to read this through and not ignore it. So I was wondering if you could just read the comics I have no problem with waiting for an episode but could you please not have to sign up to do comments it really makes this app not fun for me","2659":"This app is so wonderfully designed and is super convenient to use. Not to mention the stories are enticing and addictive, and the art is TO DIE FOR! How this app has managed to find so many talented artists and authors is beyond me but I am so thankful that they did.","2660":"I haven\u2019t wrote a review in awhile that\u2019s how much I love this app. I found some amazing mangas. One I absolutely adore is cursed princess club (CPC). I fell in love with it. The only down side is that you can\u2019t reply to messages, but you can see what you wrote which I love because I forget what I write in the comments.","2661":"Me finish a completed story a few month ago and when me want to reread me have to use daily pass and it only 2 a day beside the few in the beginning me no like but when the 14 days or so are up me have to use another daily pass me no like.","2662":"The app runs very smoothly and is very reasonable with the coin system (in my opinion). One feature that should exist is the ability to sort the \u201ccanvass\u201d webtoons by completed, you can already do this with the \u201coriginals\u201d webtoons.","2663":"Hey there! So I just came here because I love this app! I got it at the beginning o quarantine and I LOVE IT it\u2019s fun, free if you have patience and really easy to use! And for your first read I recommend murrz and\/or the wilds. But those are just my favorites! Go get the app and see for yourself!","2664":"I love the new watch a ad to watch a episode for your favorite comic but unfortunately those ads are not really working.\n\nLike I check my internet, reopen the app, and even redownload the app and the ad still won\u2019t work. I know other people are experiencing this as well so I hope it get fixed  soon","2665":"whenever i try to get my mind off of something, WEBTOON stories take me to a entirely different world. It is amazing to read these amazing, exciting, beautiful, lovely stories! It is too much to explain in words, but this app is amazing! I love it alot and i hope WEBTOON will keep up the effort!","2666":"The story\u2019s are awesome but the winter challenge where you check in each day glitches. I was day 7 and when I went to go mark another day I was at day 1, if there is a possible way to bring me back to day 7 please do,\n\nYour number one fan \n-Janelle Torres","2667":"I prefer that the WEBTOON is something daily because on how easy it would have been to finish one story and ofc it would have been sad , I love this app it has a lot of talented people here and good stories that make me have a roller coasters of feelings .","2668":"I am so happy you fixed Webtoon. It is working perfectly now and I am so happy. We will make sure to remind you if anything bad happens again give this app a 10 out of 10.","2669":"This app is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend downloading it! The quality is amazing, the stories never end, and WEBTOON keeps you updated on an information or updates on the app. Loved it since last year! \u2764\ufe0f","2670":"This app is great for keeping you reading while having fun the setup is simple and very easy to use the amount of books I can read is unpredictable. There are not bug I have com across so far, but all in all it a great app.","2671":"It\u2019s really great but I just want one thing and that is to have a feature where you can get free coins like 5 coins every day if you log in and like you can watch a video to get a coin or 2 stuff like that instead of you only buying coins","2672":"This app is great! The BESTTT! But like... I am reading Lore Olympus! And I was moving to #81 but it said Log in with this and that and like yeah I get it u need to make sure they aren't robots or anything else but I did sign in everything was good but then they said my Email was already used or like it didn\u2019t work... So if u please will reply to this!\nL","2673":"Hey umm WEBTOON app has been down for like 2-4 days now I think umm when will it be up and running again? I can\u2019t read my favorite comic story and it\u2019s making me upset like its my favorite app ever. Can y\u2019all please try and fixing it like try to be fast please","2674":"I really love this app! It\u2019s really cool and has awesome content. But a while ago it glitched and logged me out deleting all of my subscriptions and comments, luckily keeping my recents and downloads intact. I still love this app. I\u2019m just confused on why it suddenly deleted them.","2675":"I get so caught up in these stories. I haven\u2019t had anticipation like this since steaming platforms took away waiting for the next episode...   I hate it and love it. Something to look forward to.  :)","2676":"I love this app,I use it every single day! Although I have one problem, you can\u2019t upload from the app,and that\u2019s kind of inconvenient, but it\u2019s a good app other than that one problem","2677":"I got the app just to read this book \u201dUnordinary\u201d which I recommend reading and it is worth it! Love it there are lots of other books with plenty of potential, just waiting to be read.","2678":"Used to be my favorite comic reading app, but I hate this app now because of the coin system. It was way better when you didn\u2019t have to pay to read the rest of a book. By the time I can finally read the book again I\u2019m no longer interested. If this is a free app then everything should be free. My parents aren\u2019t gonna give me money for some app. This needs to be fixed but until then I\u2019m not using this app.","2679":"I really wish that as a person that has been enjoying Webtoons for a while now, maybe allowing people to subscribe to more than 100 of the discover section would make a better experience. Discover has soo many great stories I\u2019d wish to follow in app, but I can\u2019t. Please, if possible, make this better.","2680":"I love the content the app has but I only recently learned that you can like the comic chapters, not just comments, because other commenters pointed it out. I want everyone to easily support their fave artists so I think you need to make the like button more obvious.","2681":"I absolutely loved webtoon! I have an interest in stuff like bl and longed forward to the update for each comic every week! Ever since the new discover rules came out, the webtoons just aren't the same anymore. For some, the main plotline is gone! It is just super disappointing that I'm unable to read my webtoons like I used to... The new rules are causing havoc on some authors who just want to please their viewers and supporters!","2682":"Please don\u2019t do this new policy I already had to stop reading heart slayers. I love this app but the new policy is just going to ruin all the things I love. It\u2019s sad that the creators have to now censor these thing or get rid of the comic completely. Just make it when the content is inappropriate to just put censors over these things because the BL comics are awesome and I love them. Another than that keep up the good work.\ud83d\ude41\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude29","2683":"I love Webtoon and how it shares an authors creativity and connects everyone with the story. However with the new policy in place I believe that all it does is diminish creativity and disconnect people. There\u2019s so many things an author can\u2019t do on there anymore and honestly the things they have to do to get around this policy isn\u2019t good. I don\u2019t want to read their stories because they have to change it and that disheartening.","2684":"I absolutely adore webtoons, all of my favorite comic creators are on there and normally, it\u2019s 5 stars, but unfortunately because of the new policy update several of the comics I\u2019m reading are now moving to tapas and patron, 3 of those comics are my favorites and I\u2019m contemplating switching to tapas to read them. Webtoons, stop punishing creators for wanting to make money on multiple platforms, especially when they\u2019re the ones that placed you in the position you\u2019re in now. What a shame.","2685":"Great app. You see so many great artist showing their hard work. The details on majority of these are amazing. Keep it going! App works great all the time. Only thing is on iPad, unable to sign in through gmail account. But i still managed","2686":"Hours on end reading great comics is one thing I do on my spare time and with this app I now have access to so much more. The creators are always great individuals with their work and dedication to their fans and creations. This is with out a doubt 5 stars.","2687":"This app has everything for every genre. I can not think of another place where you can get such high quality entertainment for free. Tower of god, bastard, lessa, and hive are just the tip of the iceberg. I dare you, I double dog dare you to read one of these and not get hooked.","2688":"I would give this 5 stars but I wanna know why it randomly logged me out and now I can\u2019t get back into my account I just wanna know why it happed other than that I love the app and has amazing and wonder creators","2689":"This is one of the best 'reading' apps that I have used since and in forever! I'm glad this is an actuall thing people can use everyday. I use it everyday as I have finished reading 28 stories(webtoons) on this app! I say keep up the great work.","2690":"Ever since the new update, my app has been freezing up on all vertical scroll comics. An advertisement will come up, I wait for it to finish, I x it out, and then try to continue scrolling: nothing happens for a few seconds, then the app crashes. So in total, I can only see the first panel of all vertical scroll comics. Not sure why this is happening but I\u2019d really like it fixed, because I want to know what\u2019s happening :0","2691":"I woke up at 3 am to see my account had been logged out, so I logged in and saw all the stories I was reading were unsubscribed and checked my coins I have been saving from the month stamp events, (and the April event I had 2 stamps already) and they we\u2019re gone and I am very frustrated. Can you bring back my items and fix this, so maybe it can stop logging me out now!!!!!!!!! AND I HOPE ITS FIXED BY MORNING BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP AND I WOULD GET MAD AND DELETED IT OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND TELL MY FRIEND NOT TO GET IT SO PLEASE FIX THIS :)","2692":"This has literally changed my life, I\u2019ve been reading Sirens Lament\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I can\u2019t tell u how many times I cried\ud83e\udd27 it was such an amazing rollercoaster of feelings and twists and turns!! Instantmiso is the BEST!! Also I\u2019ve been reading Lore Olympus I LOVE IT IM OBSESSED\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 TY for this app it\u2019s amazing!! For anyone that\u2019s reading this GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW!!!","2693":"I love this app because there are many great things to read and even though the daily pass thing can be annoying I think that it could be worse.","2694":"I luv this app as much as ice cream with marshmallows. But it\u2019s not for kids! Kids like reading manga as much as I do!  My little sis really wants to read, but I keep having to say it\u2019s inappropriate. \nThe only one she can read is the one with appropriate words. One. Episode. AND NOTHING. NOT ONE PERSON ON WEBTOONS DOES NOT CURSE. not recommend. I luv, but hate. So pls fix AND ADD A STINKIN\u2019 CHILD LOCK!!","2695":"I really like WEBTOON and the story\u2019s on it but recently I lost all of my comments, coins, and subscriptions in the new update which was supposedly a minor bug fix but I say it brought more Evita then before. I would change it if I was able to get my date back but I don\u2019t we any advice or where to get it.","2696":"1: can y\u2019all please add a screen rotation lock function? I like to read lying down with my phone on my bed, but that impossible when the screen constantly rotates. \n\n2: an automatic clear cache option. My phone battery heat up once the cache is over 25mb, so it\u2019s be nice if the app automatically cleared the cache for me at 25mb. \n\nOverall, I would rather have option 1 than 2.  \n\nAnd I do love the app. Much more user friendly than the website","2697":"This app is awesome! But I think that maybe you should lower the amount of days you have to wait to get a new episode.  A week feels so long when you are waiting for an episode. Maybe lower it to 5 or 6 days? Even one day is much better \ud83d\ude01","2698":"This app is a cash grab. The stories are really good and they give you just enough to get hooked. Imagine if a gave you half of an amazing book that only I have, then whenever you finished half of it I charged you a ridiculous amount of money for the rest of it. I hate this app and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is the artists on here do have some good work.","2699":"They force you to either pay actual money to access the last chapters of popular webcomics, or you need to wait up multiple days for them to unlock so you can read them for free. I chose to wait. I waited 2 days to read the first of the locked chapters to a webcomic I like. When it was finally supposed to open the time just reset and it said I now had to wait 6 days. It\u2019s a complete scam.","2700":"Hey Webtoon,\n\nI would like to ask why can\u2019t I purchase my coins in my iOS account even though my parent approved it. Me and my parents had encounter an issue about downloading apps before that. Now after that issue, I click on the coin shop to buy my coins, it did not go straight to my dad\u2019s notification for him to approve it said \u201cyou can only purchase one at the time code:102.\u201d Is there something wrong with my iPad or some error. Can you please help me?\n\nP.S. I also don\u2019t know how to email you.\n\nThank you Webtoon.","2701":"Don\u2019t bother with this app. You can find equally as good webtoons without needing to be forced to pay in order to binge a whole series if you wanted to. There is a free system that gifts a single chapter each day however most the times filler chapters will just end up making me not interested and can\u2019t continue so I forget to even open the app. DONT BOTHER! just use a good manga website for equal to better content!","2702":"Love this app!!! It is amazing and anyone who is looking into it should definitely get it! There are so many plots and characters reading this and it\u2019s just so amazing. Only problem in my opinion is that it\u2019s not an animation, but it\u2019s still amazing!","2703":"I am overall happy with the app but recently Is have had this glitch where if I try to go into the app it instantly kicks me out I haven\u2019t been able to get in for a while but other than that I have no complaints","2704":"I don\u2019t know if it was the update or my phone but I can\u2019t seem to open the app like it keeps closing and exiting out every time I try to open it. But someone pls tell me how to fix it!","2705":"I\u2019ve been going on webtoon on and off since around 2017. I recently wanted to reread a series only to find out there\u2019s now a paywall behind it. I originally liked webtoon because it felt different from other websites that hosted webcomics. I just can\u2019t believe a series that was originally released free YEARS AGO is now all of a sudden behind a pay wall.  I guess now it\u2019s time for me to find a new place to read webcomics.","2706":"Honestly I love the stories on here, the creators put so much work into it, however I\u2019m currently dealing with the annoying issue of trying to remember where I was at in all the deferent stories I\u2019m reading because WEBTOON will not transfer over where you left off onto a new device, and my previous device is inoperable.","2707":"It\u2019s a really really good app But i dislike the new policy very much and I dislike the fact that for some of the webtoons you have to watch an ad which sometimes they don\u2019t load for me because I don\u2019t have Wi-Fi at my house so I can\u2019t read a lot of them and it makes me kind of annoyed so I\u2019ve kinda switched to tapas  :\/","2708":"U read anything u want drama,romance,more all of those u want are there even comedy everyone I recommend y\u2019all to download this best app ever and doesn\u2019t always tell u allow notifications so I read and I appreciate this ALOT like ALOT ALOT I give it BEST READING APP award!","2709":"Okay first off, this is literally the best anime app I\u2019ve ever read from. Everything is perfect. It\u2019s one thing to dislike anime, but to HATE THE APP?! You must have serious issues. I\u2019ve been using this for about 7 months and I\u2019m IN LOVE with the stories!","2710":"It\u2019s a very good app then other apps I use. The stories are very interesting and I don\u2019t have to pay or use coins too read a new chapter that\u2019s what I really love about this app. I really recommend this app. Its easy to use the app.","2711":"I love this app it\u2019s so intriguing. But the only part I don\u2019t like is that you have to wait so long for the next episode. And also you have to buy the episode with coins and money which I don\u2019t want to deal with lol. But overall I love this app","2712":"Webtoon, honey! You gotta add a dark mode!! Most readers like to stay up and read at night.. in the dark.. sneakily hiding from their parents. We gotta stay as low key as possible and the white, BLINDING light of your home menu is.. well, BLINDING!! IT LITERALLY GLOWS THROUGH THE BLANKETS! Please, sir. For your users and readers. \ud83d\ude4f","2713":"I hate that the app randomly stops working. I\u2019ve had to delete the app and redownload it probably a half dozen or more times in the 6mo I\u2019ve been using it. Otherwise, it\u2019s a decent platform. Also, I also hate the new daily pass thing that people are complaining about.","2714":"I love this app and completely recommend it. But I think it would be way bigger if we didn\u2019t have to waste our money on coins. I thinks it\u2019s dumb but idk about you but I hate cliff hangers. I know more people out there do it. If you absolutely despise cliff hangers I do not recommend this app what\u2019s so ever.","2715":"I love this app it has such great stories but I\u2019m really sad because I was so drawn in to my story till it said I needed yo either but the coins to get an episode or wait 5 days. Honestly I\u2019m really sad and I\u2019ll have to wait a long time to finish my story.","2716":"Won\u2019t let me read the next parts, despite me constantly saying I\u2019ll watch an ad for them.\n\nI\u2019ve re started the app, I\u2019ve made sure I have the latest update, and I even deleted the app and re downloaded it. It\u2019s so annoying I just want to read the next part and no matter what it won\u2019t let me.\n\nIt\u2019s so taunting. It\u2019s THERE, but I can\u2019t read it no matter what","2717":"I so love this app! It is so comical and awesome! Also, no ads! This thing is amazing! I was reading a SUPER funny webtoon when I was like, \u201cOh wow how am I not writing a review that totally praises this app?!\u201d So, yeah! Love this. Best you\u2019ll ever get. It even has funny comics that make God an obese man with a beer addiction!","2718":"I get all my friends hooked on this app. The stories are AMAZING and the app is wonderful! \n\nI went to the Korean WEBTOON though and they have sooooooo much more content specifically in the romance category. I really wish more were translated to English \ud83d\ude2d","2719":"i paid 4,99 USD$ for 50 coins and never received them but my money was very clearly taken out of my account, im broke and in iso so i needed something to do ill ve contacting my bank in a couple of hours to stop the payment because i never received the service i paid for","2720":"The comics take a really long time to load and then WEBTOON crashes and says not responding right now I also logged in everyday for the free coins and never got them I really enjoy this app but not these bugs so if you can please fix them thank you very much","2721":"There was an event that said you could get 5 coins if you read 100 episodes of Tower of God. I completed the challenge but when the pop came so I could collect my prize I accidentally clicked the X think it was an ad. I refreshed and refreshed but the pop up won\u2019t come back. My user is Kewl kid. Can I please have my coins? \n While it was my fault for clicking X I feel like the app should at least have an \u201care you sure\u201d before just closing it","2722":"Love the app EXCEPT for how a few of the ads will just throw you into an endless forwarding loop to look at an ad in your web browser that never actually opens. Try to go back to Webtoons and the cycle repeats. Fix that and then its smooth sailing again at 5 stars.","2723":"This app is really amazing but sometimes when I\u2019m reading a comic I swipe up to keep going down and it zooms in. Also some sometimes it moves on it own and won\u2019t let me do anything. A great app overall but that tiny bit makes it a little annoying.","2724":"I feel like it\u2019s awful to charge readers to read. There are so many different ways to monetize and micro transactions is not only playing into people\u2019s already horrible app spending addictions, it\u2019s just greedy to hoard content that was presumed to be FREE. I want to see exactly how much is going to the creators of the content as well, because that\u2019s the only thing that could justify exactly how much money this app is ripping from people.","2725":"This app is amazing. There are so many great things to read and it works really well. There is just a minor bug. When I got the update for the daily pass it lost a bunch of my stories and coins. It also lost places I was reading. Overall it\u2019s a great app. It just needs to fix that thing going on.","2726":"I\u2019m in love with this app the only thing is I wish I didn\u2019t have to wait for the next episode sometimes but you\u2019d have to understand art takes time. Other than that it\u2019s the best app I\u2019ve ever had!!","2727":"I try to buy coins to purchase the early release comics but an error comes up every time. I tried buying both the $0.99 and the $4.99 and it\u2019s the same. Please fix! I don\u2019t want to have to wait 20 days for the next toon!","2728":"I love this app because it makes you wait for the last chapters even if they are already available to give you the feeling of total accomplishment when you finish a story.","2729":"I read everything on this app all the time but for the two years I\u2019ve had it downloaded- I\u2019ve never been able to log in. So many accounts back and forth. Reinstalled multiple times. I\u2019ve made accounts on different computers. But nothing! I just want fast passes u.u","2730":"Love love love the app but there\u2019s a issue I\u2019ll be reading a comic and it\u2019ll just randomly like freeze and I can\u2019t scroll and I\u2019ll have to go in and out the app which is a bit frustrating because it happens over and over almost each chapter","2731":"I\u2019ve been enjoying Webtoon so far, but I\u2019ve noticed after a while of reading a story, it always freezes, and I have to keep on closing the app and it does that like 3-5 times in a row. It\u2019s really annoying","2732":"I really enjoyed this app it has lots of fun characters and stories and I really hooked when I start reading them. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that I have to wait till the next episode, but that\u2019s not important.","2733":"For all of the toons i try to read, the ones with music do not play their music. Instead I\u2019m met with words on a bright screen and silence. I\u2019m very fond of Sirens Lament and music is a key factor in some of their episodes. WEBTOON please fix this issue, so that my app is running the way it should.","2734":"This is probably the best app I have ever got!! I could be ok here for HOURS and not get tired of it at all!! It really is a bunch of different comics and I'm sure that even if you aren't really into comics, you can find something that you'll end up LOVING!!!","2735":"WEBTOON is one of my favorite apps, I love it, but recently they made a new policy. The new policy doesn\u2019t allow the artist to show off their amazing works or art! I think every artist should get equally amounts of respect for their work, and this new policy doesn\u2019t do that. I wish and hope they change the policy.","2736":"I LOVE webtoon! I read it daily and the creators in this are VERY talented and creative. Though, I would suggest to make things easier to upload webtoons, for instance.. on mobile because It was a bit confusing to upload in my PC .","2737":"Can you add a feature that includes something like a \u2018want to read\u2019 list I have a lot of WEBTOONs I want to read but it would be nice if They weren\u2019t mixed I. With The ones I\u2019m already read\nBut overall it\u2019s a great app","2738":"The webtoons r so addictive and it\u2019s fine to wait for the next chapter cause u get so many ideas of what could be the next chapter which makes u want to read it more and look for more manga of this type \u261d\ufe0f","2739":"This app is amazing. The only problem is the new update. I love NSFW comics so seeing that many of them had to be taken down or they had to change their entire story upsets me. When I first downloaded this app I was excited to see it had NSFW webtoons in it so I decided to keep the app. now I\u2019m not sure if I want to. Please change it back to how it originally was. This new update is killing me.","2740":"I really love I really love I absolutely love this this app and I love reading BL AKA boys love but now that there's this new policy I'm thinking will be better to go to Tapas because this new policy is just ruining webtoon and it's creators because the creators don't have the freedom now they cant sensor things just because of this new policy it's really stupid. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude2c","2741":"I love webtoon all the artists are really talented and great stories. A lot of people enjoy the app until the new guidelines for the matured content for webtoons. A lot of my favorite webtoons aren't allowed on webtoon because it doesn't follow the guidelines and so it is effecting the readers and artists. Please remove the new guidelines and make them the way before. Thank you","2742":"Listen, I understand that you want to keep webtoons safe for younger viewers but this new rule is ruining it for the older viewers and all your Discover artists. Me, along with everyone else, liked Webtoons better when that policy wasn\u2019t a thing. Please take this off. It is very annoying to the Discover creators and making your users very mad.","2743":"This used to be my very favorite comic app and I read it every day, but when the policy changed, many of my favorite authors stopped posting because of the unrealistic guidelines. I don\u2019t think webtoon realizes how many users they\u2019re losing with this, but  if you don\u2019t have a problem with the guidelines then it\u2019s a really nice app. I suppose. For Discover I think only 13+ but Published Webtoons should be okay.","2744":"Hello I don\u2019t really write reviews but I have been using your app for quite some time now and have just one little suggestion for an update maybe you guys could increase the limit of webtoons you can subscribe to.","2745":"Recently they added ads in between chapters and at the end of some. It\u2019s frustrating, I understand they are sponsors , but at least give us an option to get rid of them. I wouldn\u2019t mind paying $1 or two to not deal with them honestly. Otherwise this would\u2019ve gotten 5 stars. I love the app besides the ADs \ud83d\ude44","2746":"This is honestly my favorite app because I really like stories and I\u2019m kinda a nerd so I like to read these comics in my free time and they are very easy to find, very simple too, the stories from this app are amazing and the creators of the stories \u2764\ufe0f","2747":"This app is amazing for being able to read your favorite comics and even finding new ones! This app\u2019s interface is neat, organized and easy to access. You won\u2019t regret downloading this app in the long run and overall!!!","2748":"Webtoon is one of the best apps I think anyone can have. You can find these funny, entertaining, interesting, etc. Most of the times, and episode finishes, and you just want to read more of whatever you are reading on webtoon.","2749":"Ive used this app for about\n2 years now and lovedddd it, handdowns. Recently theres been a small bug were after in done ready a comic the app pulls up a black screen and closes. I have no idea why or if this is an bug for webtoon on iphone.","2750":"Ever since I downloaded this, I\u2019ve been addicted to it! I wake up extra early everyday to read some new WEBTOONs, and when I\u2019m out of school I whip out my phone to read some more almost instantly! And to every author of WEBTOONs, keep up the great work!","2751":"I really do love this app a lot, but some things could change. I really don\u2019t like the idea of fast passes, and having to wait a long time, or spending money on episodes.\nI would much rather like it without fast pass, I do realize this is how they make some money but it ruins the experience.","2752":"I love this app but lately the ads to unlock the episodes are crashing so could you please fix that? Don\u2019t worry I think it\u2019s temporary not permanent. Definitely enjoyed this app","2753":"I want to give this app more stars, I\u2019ve had it for years but lately it no longer saves the comics I read, which chapter I was on or where I was at in the chapter. The app used to do all of that. Please get whatever bug is causing it fixed. This has been going on for months.","2754":"ok i used to love webtoon, and i recently stoped reading it, but now that I\u2019ve come back... DAILY PASS? oh gosh no.\ni loved webtoon, because of how it wasn\u2019t like other apps and you could read any episode, and I didn\u2019t mind waiting for the next one. But now, I have to wait a DAY- just for 2 more episodes. honestly, just no. love you webtoon, but this was just the worst update ever.","2755":"Lately the app has been crashing in the middle of me reading a story. I still love the app it\u2019s just a little annoying to have to keep opening the app to read and then the screen goes black and the app closes itself","2756":"I\u2019m completely outraged that Webtoon changed their privacy policy. I LOVE using the app, but the information it takes from its users is just too much. When you accept their terms, they can read pretty much anything you do on your phone. They can read what websites you visit, the apps you go on, and what you do on those places. I\u2019m sorry Webtoon, but I\u2019m going to have to uninstall until you change your rules.","2757":"So I really love reading webtoons and I love to reread the completed ones as well and it really make me sad to see some of the completed webtoons that I love need the daily passes like Super Secret, Refund High, and Cheese In The Trap. But now I either have to use my coins or read a chapter a day so it really makes me sad.","2758":"Anytime I try to buy coins now it takes forever to load and then it\u2019s stuck like that. I love WEBTOON, but anytime I try to buy coins now I really can\u2019t because it keeps pulling up the loading screen.","2759":"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH.. So much that I am literally so angry because any time I try to click on it and read, it closes immediately. I have updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone and all kinds of things.. I just wanna read \ud83e\udd7a","2760":"I had WEBTOON since 2016 I believe and honestly I loved it at first!! It was amazing!! But then I recently just got back in it n it has all this things passes n not loving so much also it\u2019s hard when I login into my account and doesn\u2019t save where I lefted off and it\u2019s hard to find out","2761":"I have noticed whenever I used this app my phone started to heat up and the app consumes more battery than any other app. Maybe there is something wrong and you could check it for next improvements. I have an iPhone xs max so I dont really think my phone is the problem tho.","2762":"Incredible, amazing, showstopping, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this app it has kept me extremely entertained during quarantine but it is the reason for my lack of sleep :p. I can honestly say there is absolutely nothing wrong with this app","2763":"I had this app for so long and never had any problems till now, I am trying to open the app and it\u2019s not going through. I have turned off my phone and rest it as well but the app ain\u2019t opening. Please help me with this issue! I love this app a lot and just started purchasing coins as well. I really don\u2019t want to miss out on any of my favorite story\u2019s or have wasted purchasing coins to not use them. Please help!!","2764":"I really like the app but I can\u2019t get it to open like I tap on the app and it won\u2019t open up I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening and btw I\u2019m using it on an iPhone 8 I\u2019ve tried everything even deleting it and redownloading it.","2765":"I love this app so much! I spend a while on it. However, I\u2019m do not have access to a computer that I\u2019m allowed to download Webtoon on (did that make sense?) I would LOVE if a \u2018Publish\u2019 option was added on mobile devices. I really want to be able to make a comic!","2766":"I love using this app and reading the comics but when I do challenges saying it will give me free coins I do everything it says but never get the coins promised so asking is this just me or do other people have these problems","2767":"I love Webtoons. It has so many dedicated artist and a wonderful array of comics to choose. I\u2019m so glad there is a platform like this that benefits the reader with free content and the hard working artist with financial compensation if readers want to pay for more. It\u2019s a win win!","2768":"okay i LOVE webtoon but this last update is um... a bit of a problem. i cant read my series\/stories because it just doesn\u2019t load. PLEASEEE fix this asap \ud83d\ude14\u270a","2769":"Everything is awesome but I dont like the fast passes but at least it\u2019s not like lezhin which makes you pay for it. You just have to wait for it other then that it\u2019s amazing \ud83d\ude09","2770":"I downloaded some comics thinking that I could read them on the train without having to worry about them loading. Lo and behold they still won\u2019t load all the way even though I downloaded them. Love the app but this is a negative for me","2771":"I really like this app a lot...I actually fell in love with it instantly, the only problem is that every time I tried to buy coins it kept say an error was made and I tried everything they said to try if it doesn\u2019t work, but if you like to read comics I would definitely recommend WEBTOON!!","2772":"I love this and all its been great the past couple months but today when I was going to the app it took me out so i uninstalled the app and installed it but it won\u2019t install so can you please fix this","2773":"I love the app but my subscriptions get deleted. I thought it was my phone but I checked on a computer and they were all deleted. I made sure I was logged in. I was thinking maybe it got deleted because I stopped reading for a while due to lent (religious fast).","2774":"I\u2019ve had this app for a couple of years and now it\u2019s acting up on me it says that I don\u2019t have internet connection even though I\u2019m on the internet it won\u2019t let me go on the app either please help","2775":"Awesome content, the stories are great and the app is super nice. One of the best story apps I\u2019ve gotten but one thing you guys should add would be dark mode system wide on the app. That\u2019d be great but otherwise this is a great app.","2776":"I love this app, but it only crashes on my iPad. My other devices work,  but every time I open it up and I read one of the chapters and right in the middle of when I read.....it crashes.","2777":"So you know how some of WEBTOON chapters \nhave an\namazing addition \nto each chapter of their songs playing in the background .\n\n I was wondering why my music playing from another app \nhad stoped when the chapter I was reading \n\nDidn\u2019t have a song added to the chapter \n\nYet still stop my music ?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nAlso would love if you could just play the WEBTOON songs on the app singular \nwithout the need to keep my phone on \nor \neven without the need to have the series - chapter open","2778":"I love this app, I\u2019m constantly on it and I would highly recommend it to anyone. My only problem is that I\u2019m noticing that it\u2019s using up a lot of my battery life, and my phone is starting to overheat. Is there a way to fix this? Thank you for the great app!","2779":"Webtoon is so diverse, and has a lot of interesting stories! I absolutely love it! However, as a fujoshi, I have a pretty hard time finding my bl webtoons, and I wish there were a BL or LGBTQ+ tag to filter it out. ;; it\u2019s asking a bit yeah, but I hope you consider it!","2780":"I love this app. I\u2019ve been using it for a long time, and I really like the comics- the quality, the style, everything! \nBut they have a new policy about the content (sexual etc) which is a little annoying and disruptive. Otherwise a good app!","2781":"WEBTOONs is the best app ever I makes me want to read and I hate reading. This app is so amazing that I can\u2019t even put into words. It\u2019s just the best app ever with the story\u2019s to read. They have it all romance, action, fantasy, etc. It\u2019s just so amazingly awesome. I love it soooooo much.","2782":"So I think that Johns dad would die from those ember guys and John gets his power but his dad was the most powerful unordinary and he had 100% of all stats and John found the embers and seraphina helped and they killed them all","2783":"I really like reading WEBTOON but.... I do not like the new change they added. By that I mean the coin change sure you can read the next episode later on but I enjoy WEBTOON because there is no bother on buying coins for reading entertainment. I will still use the app but in my honest opinion  don\u2019t like this change.","2784":"I love WEBTOON but I\u2019d not like how I have to unlock the next episodes I just like to read and keep going not having to wait this long to unlock the next espisode I don\u2019t like how I have to pay money to get coins to unlock the next episodes but in any other words I love webtoon","2785":"I have been using this app for as long as I can remember and I love it but, the sudden change to the policy has made authors of webtoons have to drastically change their books and have nsfw scene not allowed for viewing which is very unfair, I think you guys should change this and I\u2019m sure a lot of others think this as well. Bring back the old policy, bring back the webtoon we loved. \u2665\ufe0f","2786":"Warning: if u enjoy bl or nsfw sections do not download! The new policy took away my favorite gay comics and I'm mad (T^T) now I have to venture out into the wild internet to find better comic apps. Please dear creators of web rooms, please take down the new policy. The fujoshi and fundanshis beg of you","2787":"Look WEBTOON, this app is great and I think it's been fantastic for most of its release, but the new policy on NSFW is really disappointing. I get that the app is for 9+ but there must be a better to go about NSFW. I mean why not just force creators to do a disclaimer. I mean you are limiting what creators can post on the app and that takes away creativity which in turn causes creators to leave which means less money. Think about it.","2788":"WEBTOON was better before the new update and new policy they have on there and has affected a lot of our favorite stories and the creators that made them I hope it changes before I may decided to leave and find a new app to read on or website (already have) but I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.","2789":"So a lot of the story apps give you a few free chapters and then you have to start paying every chapter but this one is different every thing is free and it has many good comics. If you don\u2019t have the app I recommend it!","2790":"Honestly, I hate comics and I always will, but webtoon is an exception. My favorite part about this app is how you can actually get to know the artist of the story. Webtoon arts amazes me, you won\u2019t find 1 artist that doesn\u2019t work hard.","2791":"I originally rated this a 4 but bc of daily pass I have to lower it, I didn\u2019t rate it a 5 bc I wish there\u2019s a feature where u could add folders to organize the webtoon comics, like ones I\u2019ve read, or reading, etc. I rlly hate the daily pass feature it just makes me wanna drop a WEBTOON so bad","2792":"A lot of wattpad readers are mad on tiktok that WEBTOON is messing up the wattpad experience because there favorite smutts are being taken out\ud83d\udc80. I love both WEBTOON and wattpad and I really don\u2019t want to see WEBTOON recieve extreme hate. Their probably planning to rate the WEBTOON app with bad reviews and get it off the App Store.","2793":"i would do 5 stars but i have a big deal breaker!! i wish that BL and GL etc. had its own \u201ccategory\u201d some may call it, for some reason i only read BL because its what makes me more comfortable and its hard to find them!","2794":"I never loved an app so much every story I read piques my interest in every story is voted on by you so you get to choose what story is going to be spotlighted it gives you choices that other apps don\u2019t give you","2795":"I love WEBTOON, the story\u2019s are amazing!! One problem. Monthly Deregister. I don\u2019t understand what this is nor how to make it go away. It doesn\u2019t even give me a choice and I can\u2019t read any comics now until I deregister or something and it\u2019s pretty annoying considering the fact that I bought 100 coins","2796":"It is so gosh darn good and the only reason there is fast pass is for the peeps too get paid and before they didn\u2019t profit and u just donated and prob one person donated so they weren\u2019t making any money so stop hating WEBTOON for trying to get money for the comic makers","2797":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE this app and I am sufficiently addicted to many of the stories. BUT I keep getting an error when I try to purchase more coins. It says that \u2018In-app purchases are not allowed\u2019 and gives me an error code:301.... how am I supposed to feed my addiction if my coin supply has been cut-off???","2798":"i bought 50 coins and they didn\u2019t give me to them even after all the restarts of the app and my phone and when i go to check my purchase history it\u2019s not there but the money was still took from my account","2799":"WEBTOON was really good before... but since all this new stuff, it\u2019s so hard to get a good read in before it says you have to wait a week to read the next chapter. It\u2019s awful. I can\u2019t enjoy the stories anymore and I sometimes forget what\u2019s even going on by the time I can read the next chapter... I really hope you guys fix this because it\u2019s not good anymore.","2800":"Just a suggestion but could you guys allow users to watch adds to gain coins because many WEBTOON readers are young people who don\u2019t have the money to pay for coins. Maybe like two 15 second adds gives a user one coin.","2801":"I understand that fast pass requires coins but why do they have daily passes for completed series? At least let us view some ads to get daily passes. Other similar apps are not limited to 2 passes per day...","2802":"I love your app but then I use it, my phone gets  real hot. I don\u2019t now but then I use another app it doesn\u2019t get real hot. But I love your app and I well use it. And if it is bug that my phone get real hot, can you fix it. Please thank you","2803":"I was reading comics perfectly fine but then after a day it just started to get stuck on the webtoon logo loading screen please fix this app is great otherwise","2804":"If your looking for something to read, this app is for you it has all kinds of genres and it\u2019s just amazing!! Really recommend it . Although some comics aren\u2019t for younger people. Besides that this app is amazing!","2805":"Ever since the new update, it seems like the app freezes a lot. I can\u2019t scroll, go back, anything, and have to restart the app every once and a while. It\u2019s not that bad to give this a horrible review, but it sure can put a damper on the reading.","2806":"Listen people this app has its flaws but all and all it\u2019s a great app. Man I think I downloaded it early 2017 and let me tell u best choice of my life and I don\u2019t make a lot of those * cough like John cough* But Thank You Creators of WEBTOON for thinking and creating this app","2807":"This is really good so far. It saves the comics you\u2019ve read so you don\u2019t have to find them again and it has cool stuff. I was reading a horror comic called missed call and you faced time with a creature and scared the living hell out of me.","2808":"I love this app absolutely do! Love all the webtoons and the community it has created... but recently I have not been able to access any comics.. the just load forever or take painstakingly long to load a panel... please help...","2809":"This app is AMAZING I love the community and how it\u2019s free to upload your own comics and read others! If you\u2019re looking for a place to publish your own comics or just looking for entertainment, I highly recommend this app!","2810":"I love this app.  It\u2019s my daily guilty pleasure to read with my morning coffee.  I love how it\u2019s organized.  I also adore the discover feature while it supports anyone\u2019s type of cartoons. It\u2019s a game changer for sure.","2811":"I have really enjoyed Webtoons the past couple of months but I\u2019m very put off by the new policy change. The previous policy about NSFW webtoons was fine in my opinion, but the new policy affects quite a bit of the comics I read. I\u2019m sure that the artists and creators of the NSFW comics are going to be hurt either by having to go through each update they have posted to correct them or having to take down their Webtoon completely.","2812":"I was really loving this comic app until they implemented the new mature content policy. So many of my favorite authors had to quit their comic. That is so rude to them. They\u2019ve put so much time and effort to make wonderful comics and it gets drowned because of the mature content. I\u2019d rather just read their stuff on patreon if this is how it\u2019s going to be. I\u2019m really disappointed. I even planned to make a comic on here...now I dont want to. Webtoon was great until the nee policy. I\u2019m so sad.\ud83d\ude1e","2813":"With the policy for NSFW contents they are destroying some creators income and career. All webtoons in the past have a notification that pops up to ask if one is old enough to read. Also creators always censor it. Yes some kids younger then the expected age do read it but as a parent you should see what your child is doing on there divice.\n\nOther then that. Good app \ud83d\udc4c","2814":"Really like this app, but like what is with the pop up ads? And no way to even pay to turn them off? My screen is broken so I have to press really hard to even get the stupid thing to respond. I'm worried it'll break my screen even worse. Please fix this? At least add a paid option. I love this app a lot, \nbut the ads are totally getting in the way.","2815":"The app is pretty easy to use, love the comics. I just wish the episode that you have read show on all devises. I can not switch reading between phone and tablet because I get lost on where I left off.","2816":"I use this app to read all sorts of interesting comics they have here. I'm an artist myself and I would like it if you are able to upload comics on mobile.\nPlease make it happen! I want to share my own story!","2817":"i signed out of my account and now webtoon won\u2019t let me sign back into it. i don\u2019t want to make another account because i don\u2019t remember everything i was reading and i don\u2019t remember where i was in some of the things. it\u2019s really annoying. every time i try and sign into my account it tells me that the email isn\u2019t registered. but when i go look at the email inbox it has a ton of emails from webtoon. and if i try and make a new account with the same email it tells me the email is already being used. can you please fix this problem?","2818":"I\u2019m completely fine with Ads during my comic but every time they appear and I exit it, the comic freezes and the app crashes. I really don\u2019t want to give this app 2 stars but there needs to be some kind of solution to the problem. It happens every time I open a comic strip and scroll just a little and then BOOM! freezes then crashes.","2819":"There\u2019s some amazing stories on this app but the daily pass for completed series is awful. No one wants to wait to reread their favorite series, especially the ones that are 100+ episodes. I\u2019d be ok if there was an ad every five episodes, but I\u2019m not paying to reread something I\u2019ve already experienced.","2820":"I absolutely love WEBTOON. It\u2019s my getaway from the stresses of life but it really started overheating my phone from the last few updates. I exited the app to write this review and my phone is already cooling down. I have the latest model too! Please fix this overheating issue!","2821":"The comics in the app are amazing, I started reading before they had that coin bull crap so I was able to enjoy my favorite ones. I get that the developers want to make more money but the coins are annoying and a monthly subscription to the app would be way better","2822":"I lately have been having a problem with webtoon stories showing the comments and likes number.","2823":"I love the app but the new daily pass is unbelievable. Like seriously I want to be able to read a finished WEBTOON without having to wait or spend money to read it. I was fine with being able to read to or three episodes a day but one? Common that\u2019s is ridiculous!!!","2824":"i love this app, and i\u2019ve been using it for two years now- BUT, in the most recent update, the app refuses to open, and i can\u2019t catch up with any of my stories. if you guys could fix this it would be greatly appreciated thank you so much!","2825":"I love the WEBTOON comics! Today when I tried to log on it had lost all my information on my account.... this meant I can\u2019t open what I have already purchased. I recently bought coins too and it says I have 0 and no transaction history. Tried to contact them no luck. Pretty annoying that it kept my place in the comics but lost all other info. I will not buy coins again.","2826":"The latest event that gives 5 free coins for daily check-ins in October has been SO buggy. The app continues to crash, and I cannot even update the app to the latest version to redeem the coins because it just freezes and quits itself. Even reading the webtoons has been a little clunky with occasional freezes lately. Please fix!!","2827":"I recommended a completed Webtoon to a friend and they were really excited to binge read. That's until the daily pass got in the way. I would rate this a 5star but the pass ruined it. I like it how it was and I really want Daily pass to be gone","2828":"This app is actually rlly good. My friend reads webtoons so she kinda forced me to download it and try it out. And I was rlly mad about that and thinking \u201coH tHiS aPp iS gOnNa bE rLly bAd\u201d. That was not the case at all I rlly love this app. And would recommend this to anyone interested.","2829":"I love this app so much but every time I try and buy coins it won\u2019t let me so if you want me to give my information then you need to fix this or just get rid of coins all together it took me forever to get my mom to let me do this so please fix this","2830":"Once I got the new update for ads on the chapters the ads wouldn\u2019t load . . . I know it\u2019s not my WiFi because it loads everything else on webtoon fine? Is this glitch common or am I the only one having this problem?","2831":"The new update came with a little box that pops up when trying to watch an ad to read the latest episode on a WEBTOON. Well. Resetting the identifier isn\u2019t working. I\u2019ve also restarted my phone. I\u2019m frustrated. I understand the reason for the ads on certain webtoons, but now I can\u2019t read the current episode. I\u2019ve had this problem since before the latest update. Please fix this!","2832":"Honestly I like the stories on there but when I tried to make an account it said that my passcode had to be a minimum of 6 letters and it was eight letters it also said that my email wasn\u2019t right even tho my email was right so I can\u2019t make an account because it won\u2019t allow any passcode I put in","2833":"I LOVE this app, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t rlly like the idea of paying for a \u201cfree comic\u201d if it\u2019s a \u201cfree comic\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything right? It\u2019s Awesome I highly enjoy it! It\u2019s just that, I LOVE YOUR APP tho\ud83d\ude0d highly recommend if you LOVE comics! BUT ANYWAYS!!!! I absolutely love love LOVE this app highly recommend\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70","2834":"My daughter initially downloaded this free apps and she didn\u2019t know there is in-apps purchase of coin. I didn\u2019t know about the charges until I saw the history. I have lost so much money and I have no control of this. Someone is resetting my Apple ID password and purchasing coins every month even though my daughter is not using. Apple support is not helping to get the refund either. STAY AWAY.......STAY AWAY....STAY AWAY","2835":"Since I\u2019ve had my phone taken away I now have to use my school iPad but every since I\u2019ve downloaded this app it loads but then crashes. I can\u2019t even log in without it crashing. Please fix this problem I am every fond of webtoon. I love the art style and stories on this app I would love to be able to read them on my school iPad without it crashing","2836":"I love WEBTOON but recently I\u2019ve been having a problem trying to read comics, like if I clicked on a comic it won\u2019t load and freeze the app. I don\u2019t know if something like this is happening to everyone or maintenance but I can barely read any comics","2837":"I can\u2019t sign in because it says my email and password don\u2019t work I tried 4 different emails and they don\u2019t except and my password says its related to my email but it\u2019s not. The only story I got interest in is \u201cnot even bones\u201d and that\u2019s it almost all the other ones are weird 2 box story\u2019s so ya they can do better","2838":"I\u2019ve been reading webtoons for i\u2019m gonna say about 2 years and then when i tried to get in cause i noticed a comic update it wouldn\u2019t let me read any comics, every time i would click on a comic it would freeze the webtoons screen and it would be grey and stuff-","2839":"So when I try to make an account or log in on my iphone through the app, it won\u2019t work. It\u2019s like it\u2019s an app that\u2019s been deactivated. But on my tablet which is also an apple product, uses webtoon . I can make an account and log in without any issues! Please fix this because I\u2019m tired of it!!","2840":"I love this app I\u2019ve had it for a year now and the only thing Ive seen wrong was it taking a while to load and that was likely my inter webs. It\u2019s free and if you want to read it somewhere where the connection is bad you can download it before you leave.","2841":"I had this app for a long time and it has always been the best app I have. When I first installed it I thought it would be dumb but when I started getting on it every day I grew into liking it more.","2842":"This app is absolutely great I have nothing bad to say, but I was wondering since I finishing the new reading each day. It says you will receive 5 coins but I don't think I ever received them?","2843":"This 'daily pass' or whatever is really  ridiculous! I thought webtoon was supposed to be FREE! I mean really do they even consider the people who don't have money to even read tier favorite comic?!?! Im tired of having to look them up on other sites just to keep reading it's pointless and extremely annoying","2844":"I'm the type that listens to music all the time unless I'm talking to someone, ESPECIALLY while I read. I didn't have this issue till a few weeks ago. I cleared my cache and I've deleted it and installed it again. Everything else about the app is great, I just really hope they fix this issue.","2845":"I love all the stories, and ads haven\u2019t been bad, but now an ad pops up and takes over the whole screen, and as soon as I exit out of it, the app freezes and then exits out. That is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.","2846":"This app is incredible all the comics brighten up my day. However, I think that there should be a way to manage your own discover comic on the mobile version. Thank you for your time.","2847":"The app keeps freezing when I go in to read a story. It only started happening when I got the new update and I saw reviews where others had the same issue with no indication this will be fixed. I love WEBTOON and would like to read the great stories it has so please fix soon.","2848":"I really love the diversity and the creativity amongst different artists in this website\/app. However due to this new policy, this really constricts some artists way of creativity. There must be someways to continue NSFW without removing the artists work altogether. I\u2019m afraid this will affect most of my favorite webtoon due their dark concepts. Until this has been resolved, I suggest everyone to find other app or website that will promote artist\u2019s creativity.","2849":"I loved Webtoon up until the added the new policy. I feel like it restricts creators in an extremely unfair way, and many of my favorite artists are discontinuing their Webcomics because of it. Countless other artists have also left the platform to find other comic sharing websites that will allow them to share their work and passion in the way it was first intended to be. As for me, I plan to follow them. Looks like I won\u2019t be using Webtoon anymore.","2850":"I really love this app, like it\u2019s amazing! Highly recommend it but the new adult content policy made me really sad. I believe they should take it away because the warning on adult content is fine but taking it away completely is really saddening since to me those are the juiciest stories. Please Webtoon rethink it, it would be much appreciated\u2764\ufe0f","2851":"This app is really great when it comes to finding an interesting story to fall in love with. What I (and many others) HAVENT fallen in love with is the new policy. I understand that most readers dislike the NSFW romance comics, but that\u2019s exactly why there\u2019s a warning before reading every WEBTOON. It\u2019s not fair that we should all be punished because readers purposely decided to disregard the warning and ruin the experience for the rest of us.","2852":"It gets so addicting and extremely entertaining! Especially, like me, when you publish your own comics, it is so easy to interact with your readers and publish your comics. I would say this is the best app I have on my phone right now.","2853":"I read multiple series and it keeps me up to date all the time and with all the music track it really brings the stories to live definitely one of my most favorite apps!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d","2854":"This app has cured my boredom many a times and I sincerely hope this app becomes more and more popular because it\u2019s really a great idea and gets other people\u2019s (creators) ideas out there along with more popularity.","2855":"As a visual learner, I appreciate having this app filled with pictures and comics, lots of them I laugh at, cry, sometimes wanna chuck my phone at the wall, or simply smile. Definitely recommend this to any aspiring comic artists or people who seek to escape to different worlds \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","2856":"As the title, this app is the best way to read comics. In this app we can find anything our king like action or romance that is full of heart touching comics. As in total, I\u2019ll say this app is one of a kind comic app for young people and also adults.","2857":"Web toon is an amazing app. The only problem would be that I have to wait a whole week or some times less for one episode. But all the comics are amazing and I love them so much. I think I\u2019m addicted. \ud83d\ude05","2858":"Many stories that are top tier! The thing is that there are so many bots that spam scammer links in the comment section. Please make people do a human verification thing before they make an account, so there wont be any bots.","2859":"I can login just fine on the website but the app always says \u201cincorrect password\u201d no matter how many times I try. Changed my password, and typed it in extremely slow to make sure it\u2019s correct.. I still can\u2019t login thru the app\u2014only the website","2860":"I use it a while. First time it say my phone is an unknown device since I haven\u2019t change device. No one have money to buy many different devices. Still use the same phone so I don\u2019t know what happen.","2861":"i used to love webtoon used to read it all the time but the fact ur trying to get rid of peoples work on wattpad is awful. they spend months writing it and you guys are trying to make it \u201ckId FrIeNdLy\u201d that\u2019s not gonna happen the entire point of wattpad is for smut. your creators would be upset if there smut (which comes with pictures) got deleted bc they had smut. if you get rid of smut books your ratings will go down sorry","2862":"I love this app, don\u2019t get me wrong but the pop ups that let you tap the \u201cdo not show again\u201d option are not legit. I still get these same pop ups whenever I open the app, it is a little annoying.","2863":"I love this app it has loads of great comics to read and I always download some when going somewhere but there is a bug sometimes where the comic panels combine or the comic restarts and I have to scroll back down to find where I was.","2864":"Now when I saw a wedtoon ad and I was interested in the story, but when I did I didn\u2019t see it, if you is like the beginning and is not one of my interests, please remove it. I don\u2019t know what genre it is, but just remove that feature!","2865":"This is a amazing app I spend way to much reading comics. The interface is flawless and it rarely has glitches and has a good algorithm. Over all great service","2866":"I would give this a five star but I just hate looking into such a bright light even when I turn my screen brightness to the lowest settings it still is to bright I would prefer if you added a dark mode.","2867":"PLEASE.  Please add an auto scroll feature preferably with adjustable speed...extra bonus if very popular comics have slightly different rates throughout, ie action panels move quicker, intense moments with a LOT of speech bubbles move nice and slowly.  Thanks, love the app.","2868":"The daily passes are a terrible idea. I never post reviews and I\u2019m so annoyed with daily passes that I\u2019m sharing this.\nI get fast passes because it\u2019s paying for advanced access but allowing people to read only one episode of a completed series per day without spending money on coins is stupid and will stop a lot of people from reading webtoons.","2869":"I love everything about webtoon. There\u2019s an endless amount of stories to read for FREE!!! My friends have even made their own which is pretty cool. I\u2019d definitely recommend to anyone that hasn\u2019t tried it yet :)","2870":"You use to be able to read old stories for free. All episodes were free. Now you can only read them with these things called daily passes. You can only read 2 episodes a day now while it use to be free. Obviously WEBTOON has become money hungry so I suggest not reading from this unless you really want to pay to watch stuff. I thought WEBTOON was better but obviously not. Just another money hungry company.","2871":"I keep trying to get into the app and it doesn\u2019t even load, I\u2019ve deleted the app and redownloaded it in hopes that it would be fixed but it hasn\u2019t.\n\nLove the comics and don\u2019t really want to throw this app away forever. Pls update\/fix it.","2872":"Unlike everyone else myn will be quick, I love it all but could u maybe have all of the webtoons be like a video so we don't have to swipe all of the time and have to read it cuz I think that's what would make it more popular","2873":"I. Love. This. It\u2019s awesome but Especially in quarantine but I can\u2019t get an account and I miss out on a lot so please ad more things for people without accounts (this was just a suggestion you don\u2019t have to do it) Keep This Awesomeness Coming!!!","2874":"I love this app, but the new add update isn\u2019t working for me, I\u2019ve tried everything. It also seems like I\u2019m not the only one with this problem, I love everything else about webtoon otherwise","2875":"I have had webtoon for about 2 years and a half I just absolutely love it I highly recommend getting the app it\u2019s the best thing every! When I have a bad day out school I read webtoons to make me happy\u2764\ufe0f\u2728","2876":"I love the stories and everything but seriously I don\u2019t want to have to wait 5 days in order to see one episode. I mean seriously I\u2019ve been reading The Four of Us and apparently I now have to wait 5 days to unlock ONE episode. That\u2019s absolutely absurd. I mean seriously fix that please.","2877":"I\u2019m sorry but since the last update made the app unusable I believe I\u2019m going to be deleting it until I see that my issue is fixed. \nEvery time I try to open the app it will freeze, load maybe one story cover\/episode number, and then just stop working all together.","2878":"My entire app wasnt working. Id open a webtoon and it didnt load in. Wouldnt even give me a way to back out because it would just stop responding so I deleted and reinstalled the app. Then I found out that all my history of everything ive ever read and whay im currently reading or planned on getting back to- has been wiped. Its all gone. I really hope this gets sorted.","2879":"With the recent update, the time from boot to reading now takes a minimum of 30 seconds (iPhone SE)! That\u2019s HUGE compared to the near-instant access. It\u2019s like the app now refuses to open a comic unless everything in the background is loaded. It\u2019s maddening for on-the-go use when you just want to scroll through a few panels during spare moments.","2880":"The app is amazing the comics. Everything is great.I would totally give the app a 5 star review except the only bad thing is the wait. I have to wit for a week for one more episode to come out. I think the developers should lower how long you wait.","2881":"This used to be my favorite app for comic reading, because of the freeness. However, I\u2019ve noticed that WEBTOON is apparently trying to milk their readers dry. Pop up ads I can\u2019t get rid of, those are incredibly annoying. Plus the daily pass and the fast pass, this app isn\u2019t even good anymore. Til for new readers: just see if you can pirate, because this company doesn\u2019t deserve any money.","2882":"Completed 2 of their challenges lately. Waited about a week to see the coins and they never appeared. I contacted support. I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t even look at the message I actually sent. Been weeks now and I still haven\u2019t received my coins. Went from being my go to app to \u201cCan\u2019t really like something if someone can\u2019t keep their word\u201d.","2883":"I wish u would add a setting where you can turn off the music on the app so u can listen to ur own music without it being turned off for the sounds from the app","2884":"I love the stories! I love the drawings! I love the diversity! Only two minor things bug me: 1) you can only search for genre or title e.g. \u201cvampire\u201d won\u2019t work except if it\u2019s in the title! 2) I wish there was a way to get coins without paying e.g. having the possibility to watch ads to receive coins","2885":"I love this app and I don\u2019t mind buying coins to read ahead. It makes sense for not wanting to wait. My biggest issue recently has been the addition of the daily pass. Why do I need to pay for something that\u2019s already completed and I had read once before? I recommend Orange Marmalade to so many friends, but now they can\u2019t read it (past 2 episodes per day) unless they pay for it?","2886":"I LOVE this app but one thing I like to do is organize so if you could make it so we could rearrange comics easier. Other than that I think this app is great totally recommend this app for everyone!","2887":"I\u2019ve been on webtoon for a long time! For a long while, it was free and easy to read and enjoy! Unfortunately, they\u2019re growing increasingly money-oriented. If you don\u2019t have extra money to spend on comics, I wouldn\u2019t get too attached when downloading this app. The artists and stories are amazing though!","2888":"I\u2019ve been an avid webtooner and fastpass user for a while now. Until recently when the phone I was using was damaged and I no longer can use it. Now that I have a new phone I no longer have access to my coins or episodes. Is there anyway I can have access to my fastpass coins? I still have the login info just don\u2019t have my things. And I\u2019ve paid a lot of money that I\u2019d hate to see go to waste :(","2889":"I love this app because you get to read episodes without being distracted and these episodes are really entertaining! And I\u2019m so glad I found this app other wise I would just be bored watching Netflix. :)","2890":"It is great but right now it says that I have poor connection even tho the rest of my apps work perfectly fine even when I am not on the internet. Please fix this problem","2891":"So I think  we should get about 50 coin when we join cause sometimes you need to wait days if you want to read it now you need to pay five coin and he do not hav e coin when you join so you can real it that what me mad so plz give us the coin","2892":"Nothing could be better than this app! I love all the stories it has to offer and I think it is amazing that most of the app is free. This app has really provided me with great entertainment and happiness. \ud83d\udc9c\n11\/10","2893":"It\u2019s a great app but I can\u2019t listen to music at the same time as reading. Idk if it\u2019s a setting to change or what but if I try to listen to music in the background it just cuts out. I would give it a five star other than that one thing though.","2894":"Hi! So I just got the app WEBTOON, and I was like, \u201cYes! Now I can make stories!\u201d After it finished installing, I opened the app and immediately tried looking for SOMETHING that looked like a create story button. When I thought I checked everything, I went and searched through HELP at least 5 times. Not Ideal. I still can\u2019t find it....and I don\u2019t really want to read stories that others have made, I want to MAKE them. I hope you understand","2895":"Please return this feature. There was literally no reason to remove it and constantly scrolling with my thumb is starting to cause pain and getting to the point where I'm having to use a stylus to scroll","2896":"I love this app so much! It\u2019s such a wonderful and supporting community. Anyone can make a comic (as long as it\u2019s within guidelines) about anything. I have so many comics and stories that I have fallen in love with on this app. Its amazing and I recommend it.","2897":"So when I go to sign in I put my gmail but it says it\u2019s not registered, then when I go to sign up it says that my gmail has been already registered even though it hasn\u2019t. I need help please!","2898":"So I\u2019ve had WEBTOON for over a year and just recently WEBTOON just logged me out and now I can\u2019t log back in. I used Facebook to sign in (where all my subscribed webtoons are), but it just took me to the app and nothing happened afterwards. I also tried to delete it and re try but the same thing happened. Please tell me what to do because I\u2019m addicted to webtoon! Ps I really dislike the new policy","2899":"I read on this app occasionally (I have like a lot of stories but I never read them keisjeieb I\u2019m trash), but recently this app has been annoying me. I\u2019ll go to read a story and it\u2019ll open one story but then it won\u2019t even load another until the entire app just forecloses. Really annoying.","2900":"I love this app!- when it works, that is.\nI have an iPhone 8 and WEBTOON only opens and stays open on occasion. \nI tend to have the issue of opening the app then it will freeze and crash before I even have the chance to click on anything.\nIf anyone knows how to fix this problem, I would be grateful for the advice.\nBesides that, it\u2019s a wonderful archive for comic artists to be found and their work be easily accessible to all with just a click\nI love the app, but I would love it more if it wouldn\u2019t crash so often.","2901":"When I downloaded this i new it was perfect and it was but the only thing was that is was really really REALLY slow but I was fine with that but I\u2019m glad this is existing and I\u2019m hoping it is in the future.","2902":"I love this app. When I get bored (which is really easily) I can just open up and read a WEBTOON. It\u2019s really addicting once you read a story and you can\u2019t stop, until you end the story and wait for the next episode.","2903":"I really enjoy reading WEBTOONs on discover but ever since the new policy came out, many of my favorite WEBTOON creators were not able to post their stories freely like they used too. So I really hope WEBTOON is able to remove their new policy, as it affects many creators and their stories.","2904":"I like webtoon what I liked most about it is how much creativity they gave the authors, but i feel this new policy doesn\u2019t allow them to express themselves and the story because of this I want to say that webtoon was perfect the way it was before now it disappoints a lot more than before and makes it harder for the authors.","2905":"Like I said it\u2019s great but a few days ago it started to glitch out where if I read a WEBTOON and I go on to the home page, it just freezes the screen and I have to refresh the app every time. If you could fix that, it would be awesome. Thanks","2906":"So ive been seeing recently on webtoon vomics that i read about this new policy against nsfw scenes and that even if its censored the authors and creators cant post their work. I think its unfair to me and many other readers because most put warnings and age limits on these comics and your punishing the majority for what? Runing these peoples stories theyve work hard on that they do for fun not paid to work on for what?? I think the policy should be revised and a little more open.","2907":"I love the stories that you can read, some of those include I Love Yoo, Siren\u2019s Lament, Lumine, Bastard, & Unordinary. I recommend you read them. I personally am not a fan of anime, but I stay for the great plots and these authors are so talented as well.","2908":"This app is really entertaining and I love that you don\u2019t need to pay to read great webtoons. I definitely recommend it! Also don\u2019t forget to like and comment on your favorite webtoons, and become a Patron if the artist if you can!","2909":"I can never get enough of it!!  I\u2019m not the type to be patient. When I have to wait for something I lose my interest but I\u2019m always excited what I\u2019ll read next the following week!!!\u2764\ufe0f","2910":"Webtoon features so many awesome stories that all I have to do is put on headphones and read! It has so many good comics I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes taking some time to relax with a good book!","2911":"Enjoy using this app! However I\u2019ve encountered a strange issue where my phone keeps alerting me the app no longer exists in the App Store and so I haven\u2019t been able to open it for a few days now. I\u2019m so sad!","2912":"You\u2019re bored and you have nothing to do... But Webtoon can save that. There are over a millions of webtoon that you can read. Whatever you want is in there. Romance... Action... comedy... thriller... It\u2019s all here... There is no way you can get bored now... It is a life saver \u20223\u2022","2913":"Ok this WEBTOON made so many books to anime movies which is sick like, true Beaty is a movie nobeless is anime which is sick and high school of god is anime like whattttt this is insane and sweet home sweet is so good which is a horror movie and I think their more that is becoming movies as well.","2914":"I had stories saved and in my recently read, then I didn't use the app for a little bit like maybe 3 days and all of those stories were gone and now half of my stories are not back at the original amount of episodes and is still in 2015 time.","2915":"It\u2019s an awesome game and it has so many fun stories! I have been so mad because I can\u2019t wait for more episodes to come! I love the game and would definitely recommend to all my friends!","2916":"I love some of the stories on this platform but it\u2019s a bit frustrating having to wait longer than the promised time between seasons for some comics. I\u2019ve been reading brimstone and roses (has yet to return), let\u2019s play (has yet to return), and the devil is a handsome man (has yet to return, it's been over a year).\nWhy spend our money on fast passes if we\u2019re only going to get left high and dry? Do better.","2917":"I like This app so much can we please have an update where someone can read the book with audio have someone read the book to us instead of reading it by ourselves","2918":"I love this app I can garante you will be addicted after reading the third chapter to every book there I hate having to wait so long tho but I understand what the creators are doing but in the end it is so worth it!!! I promise you will love it!","2919":"my last comment here was about webtoon needing a dark mode for us late night readers. I\u2019m so very delighted to say that as of 3 days ago... WE HAVE DARKMODE FOR WEBTOON WOO!!! I\u2019m so glad and I feel like my voice has been heard. Thank you so much! I love this app even more now","2920":"The app itself is really good but when I signed in on another device I lost all my books and nothing saved, and there was this one book I really liked and I can\u2019t find it even when I search for it\ud83d\ude14.","2921":"Webtoon email verification doesn\u2019t sent it to me on my mail, I did it a couple times but it somehow doesn\u2019t work and made me reset and have to write my email again. What should I do?","2922":"episodes i havent read yet dont come up and then when i go check it says i have to wait another week to read it but that usually happens when a new episode drops and i wait the next week to reas it but im this case i go to the webtoon and click on the episodes i havent paid for aka the ones that drop on certain days , and it says i have to wait another 7 days \/week. but the thing is i havent read that episode or it hasnt even dropped please fix it i tried my best to explain what is happening","2923":"Okay so I used to love this app. I recently redownloaded it just to see daily pass thing? Why should I have to wait a whole day just to read what, two pages of a comic? This is by far ridiculous and I'm deleting it. I'm just trying to read certain books, but no. I'm done, Line. This is completely ridiculous.","2924":"Man im just trying to read some BL stories and half of them have ads and I can\u2019t get read the newest chapters now because the ads won\u2019t load, it also completely crashes my phone and drains the battery whenever I try and watch one of these ads, I understand that it is in beta testing but it is god awful","2925":"Love the app, just wanted to make note to you that the bookmark feature keeps having me marked a chapter later then the one I was one, thank you.","2926":"I love WEBTOON but I\u2019m a little irritated as of late because whenever the \u201cwatch and ad to read the newest episode\u201d pops up and I click okay it says \u201cunable to load ad\u201d and my FAVORITE webtoon uploaded with this and I\u2019m unable to read it because of that, please fix this if you can","2927":"I cannot scroll down, the interface is a pop up whenever I log in and links received from my email will automatically open in safari instead of the app. I like webtoon itself but the app is problematic","2928":"every time i log in, it just stay frozen. it wouldn\u2019t load. i TRIED everything but it still wouldn\u2019t work. i think it\u2019s because of the new update. it said it would fix minor bugs. well, guess what? this IS a major bug. i put 3 stars cuz i love it but this needs a fix.","2929":"I have been trying several different apps like this one but WEBTOON is by far my favorite. They have amazing stories and it does not coast you an arm and a leg to read them! Would 100% recommend.","2930":"It\u2019s a really great app, it brings stories easily. But, I have a problem with finding out how to get free coins. I just want to continue one of my favorite stories but I have to buy something to get them. Maybe like an ad that gives you coins?","2931":"I love this app, i really do buuut i did that new coin event to get 5 coins and i finished it but i never got my coin....like the thing didn't pop up and my webtoon is as far as i know updated, i dont know if its a glich but please help me out.","2932":"One of my favorite apps, helps me escape. However I mostly use it at night before bed so I think a \u2018dark mode\u2019 feature would be wonderful. Other than that, no complaints","2933":"I have had this app for one week! It has been great no bugs so far! But there is this thing where. It won\u2019t let me log in. When I put my email address and password in. it won\u2019t let me log in. Please fix it! \ud83d\ude2b","2934":"Ok so this app is cool but idk how to make an acc so I used my smart skills and made one I love all ur funny comics there perfecto  but also I think ur drama comics are cool to , my friends and I think ur app is awesome ( btw they think it\u2019s awesome I thinks it cool )    So yeah keep up the good work \ud83d\udc4d","2935":"To be honest this app for comics and manga is amazing. As a lbgtq+ person there\u2019s ALOT of comics that are lbgtq+ like and it\u2019s amazing! Some stories even tho it\u2019s not lbgtq+ it touches my heart all the time and gives me happy chills instead of constant anxiety! Love what u did keep on going \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\ude05\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f","2936":"Webtoon comics are what I look forward to every single day. They\u2019re the highlight of my day!! One thing I\u2019d like to search by is keywords. For instance, if I\u2019m looking for a comic with Vikings, I\u2019d like to be able search \u201cVikings\u201d and those Viking comics pop up.","2937":"This app makes me spend hours at a time reading. On the first night I got it I was reading all the way until 5 in the morning!! The story\u2019s are great and it gives many options to people!!","2938":"I love this app. I\u2019ve never been one to write reviews, but this app is absolutely amazing. There are not any adds. The creators are but really make the app though, with each story having unique plots and great character design","2939":"So they added coins to buy a fast pass to your favorite comments amazing idea right? Well it would be if they didn\u2019t confuse all of us by adding free coins and then never adding a way to get free coins if the developers are reading this please fix this","2940":"I\u2019m going to be honest. I love this app. The array of comics and the overall premise is great. My only suggestion would be adding a \u201clove\u201d system. Practically, if you love a certain chapter of a comic, you can favorite it so that you always remember that chapter and can go back and read it with ease.","2941":"I was able to send an email to their so called customer service about double charging my purchases. After all those questions they asked me, following bunch of instructions via emails, they never got to solve the problem. It seems like they do not really understand the issues even though I sent them attachments of my purchase and online receipts. I\u2019m very disappointed.","2942":"First of alllll \nIT DOESN'T LET ME SIGN UP\nlike I started reading this really good comic and once as I got to episode 10 it said I had to sign up and which I tried and noooooooooooooo like i would fill in everything and click sign in and it would just show me my email like if I missed something and I checked many times retyped it and even changed it and I checked everything else and everything else was fine so like WhAt?!?!pls help","2943":"Omg I\u2019m on this app all the time looking for new comics to read, and I find a lot you can look in the featured or discovered webtoon sections to find a new one to read. The comics range from horror to romance. Let\u2019s just say this is the best app ever.","2944":"I love the app it so amazing and helps people start doing comics and teach them how to do them. One recommendation is to put something up so when people don\u2019t remember the title of the comic they can search up the author. In all I love the app.","2945":"I\u2019m sorry,I love you guys but really?! My favorite authors are suffering because of this new policy! I can\u2019t take it! I have used this app for a couple years but now I just can\u2019t anymore. Things have gotten downhill real quick. Maybe if things change I\u2019ll come back. I\u2019m really sad this is the deciding factor. All on a bad policy. My friends have stopped using this app too.","2946":"I used to love coming to WEBTOON when I was bored and wanted to read a comic. But since the new policy came along, I can\u2019t enjoy my favorite comics as much as I used to. I think something should be done about this because it is stopping many people from enjoying everything that this app has to offer.","2947":"Let me start with WEBTOON is one of, if not the best apps I have used ever. Unfortunately this new policy does nothing but hurt readers and artists\/authors alike. Stories that delve into tricky subjects or that contain NSFW content should not be pulled because someone can\u2019t handle it. Put an age restriction or some sort of maturity rating tag but don\u2019t punish authors for their content. Once the policy goes away, it\u2019s getting 5 stars again. Thanks","2948":"I used to love WEBTOON all the different story\u2019s and stuff but the recent change in their policy has made it to where there\u2019s nothing even that special about it the authors are being affected so the readers are getting antsy and annoyed and honestly if it doesn\u2019t change hope my favorite authors find somewhere else to upload content so it will be enjoyable again.","2949":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is my favorite app and I absolutely LOVE everything about it, BUT they\u2019re adding some new policies that authors have to follow and it affects a lot of the amazing stories I read. \n\nSo, I\u2019m leaving a bad rating to help get the attention of the webtoon administrators so hopefully they\u2019ll see that fans are not pleased. Peace\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0b\n\nBTW if you\u2019re thinking about getting this app, definitely DO it\u2019s wonderful but help if you can with our little policy protest. Thanks!","2950":"Webtoon actually has some really great comics on it like Gosu and Room of Swords that make it worth checking out, but I suggest you stick to the website unless you wanted to be greeted with a screenful of ads for progressive\/romantic nonsense every day. They\u2019ve been headlining (and this is real I\u2019m not making it up) \u201cMy Dictator Boyfriend Supreme Lover\u201d for over a month, along with a number of boring romantic comics of various orientation.","2951":"WEBTOON is a great app. And I have had no problems with it till now. I don\u2019t even know how to explain this. Well, I was reading a comic from My Giant Nerd Boyfriend and I got a horrible advertisement. I\u2019m so confused. It was an ad for A PORN SITE!!! With a very graphic image! I\u2019m just baffled. Who do I talk to about this? I don\u2019t even know.","2952":"So I love this app so much it\u2019s fantastic, I can\u2019t get enough of all the amazing stories and your format is awesome don\u2019t change anything it\u2019s great! Only thing is, I wish the translated comics were better translated idk how that can be maybe it\u2019s up to the artist. Not sure.","2953":"Plz don't send me a message that isn't about my webcomic subscriptions or new launches. great app overall, but y'all scared the daylights out of me when y'all sent a weird message with some sort of Asian letters or symbols. And I thought sky net was about to send a T-16 to my front porch.","2954":"I got this app many moons ago and was like ok all give it ago and it was the funnest app ever but lay I keep get these god for Saken adds that keep crashing the app honestly just because I\u2019ve seen the same game add over and over and over agin I\u2019m never going to get that game or play that game just because it keeps crashing my bizz other then that great stories fun way to pass time","2955":"I LOVE this app, not only you don\u2019t have to pay. But the stories are amazing, the art is so detailed and, the way the authors write, make me jump. I always get so mad at myself for finishing a comic in a day. But I really do recommend getting this app.","2956":"This is a great app but there is one slight problem when i was reading \u201cDown To Earth\u201d I was about to go to episode 55 but then when I was going i needed to purchase 5 coins but I didn\u2019t really want to so I have to wait until tomorrow to read it.","2957":"I would give this a 5 stars but my one problem for WEBTOON is that after they started the age thing where you say your age if you\u2019re underaged you won\u2019t be able to read the comments on any WEBTOONs","2958":"So I was longed in to I can comment and I opened the app one day and it\u2019s was like put in parent\u2019s email and it\u2019s not working and it starting to annoy me I will right a bad review on this if u don\u2019t fix it I\u2019m not happy!!\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c","2959":"Webtoons used to be great until this Fast Pass feature came about and I can\u2019t reread my favorite series anymore without spending money. Maybe adopt a system like Tapas where people can have the chance to earn free coins instead of paying when they don\u2019t have money.","2960":"Can we please please please get some sort of monthly fee to read whatever we want instead of paying for coins??? I\u2019d be willing to spend a decent amount for that. Otherwise this is one of my favorite apps","2961":"Like why Do we need coins to get another episode why can we just go it there with out Paying it and I wish they see my one why don\u2019t you get 5 coins every Day so you have some for the next Day .","2962":"When I got the app I loved it even with the fast passes but the daily pass is too much it\u2019s finished ok give it a break it\u2019s so annoying and sometimes it\u2019s just stuck on the same day and never lets you read it","2963":"Hey people! Basically this app is really fun and I spend a lot of time on it. I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s all free! I definitely recommend this app if your looking for something to binge besides tv during quarantine.","2964":"This is amazing the graphics for the pictures the stories everything about it is amazing and they have every genre 5 stars definitely","2965":"I honestly love reading Webtoons. It\u2019s so addicting to read and I love that we could chose the genre we want to read. The thing that annoys me is the Daily Pass. Please consider removing it because I\u2019d like to read as much comics as I\u2019d like.\n                 Thank you for reading this.","2966":"I have been on this app for years now I do love the webcomics on here and now some are being made into animes but with the most recent update it crashes upon opening and can\u2019t access it.","2967":"I love reading webtoons and this was my favorite app to read them on, but having to use a daily pass to read a completed series??? That\u2019s too much i would have to get a pass to read a series already completed is just ridiculous. I liked it better when I got to read a completed series in one go now I can\u2019t even go back and read them","2968":"I had a good amount of coins but the app updated and signed me out and when I logged back in all of my coins were gone even my free ones. I still have my data from when I was reading saved but not my coins. \nI\u2019m on the same device as well so it\u2019s not that.","2969":"Very upset I cannot read anything right now because the app keeps crashing. I\u2019ve restarted my phone and deleted and redone loaded the app. Nothing is helping it just crashes when I try to open it. \ud83d\ude21","2970":"Signing in is a pain so I don\u2019t but I can\u2019t use fast pass and you have to wait 3 days for it so yeah boiiiiii no lumine and watermelon are really good stories but you have to wait so I\u2019m stuck on a cliffhanger like what noooooooo so please do me a favor and make them free please and thank you bai bai","2971":"Overall, WEBTOON is a great way to quench your boredom. There are so many genes and stories to choose from! However, as an aspiring comic artist I think it would so convenient to add the publish feature that is on computer to the iPad or other devices.","2972":"I loved all the comics on here, the creators, writers, and artists are fantastic at their comics. They have schedules for daily uploads, some weekly, some monthly but all worth it for FREE! Although, just on my third day and the app crashes when I try to login, HELP !!!! I WANT TO KEEP READING :(","2973":"I love this app, but I randomly got logged out of my account one day and it never let me back in. Every time I tried to log in it said please check the password or email, I even reset the password and it still wouldn\u2019t work. I know I said typed the email right too. Please let me back into my account.","2974":"Ok I love WEBTOON. The stories are amazing and the art is beautiful. I even don\u2019t mind waiting a week to read the stories. But here\u2019s what I dont get. Why is it that when a story is about to come out in let\u2019s say an hour. It\u2019s been an hour but it says free soon. I just don\u2019t get it.","2975":"Webtoons has really awesome stories, art and VERY talented creators. All of the stories are free to read. This app is totally worth it, and it is very addictive (if you find some stories to binge read). \n    10\/10 rating","2976":"We should be able to follow an author instead of a specific comic they publish so that we can read all the work under their user!!!!!!!!!","2977":"I really appreciate how it\u2019s bringing all these artists into a place they can more easily be recognized, but if I could not be forced into a link every time I accidentally touch a add (due to swiping) that would be great...\nOtherwise I love a lot of these stories and also really appreciate it as a single accessible site.","2978":"Everytime i read one episode of a comic it freezes up and i have to restart my whole entire app again! I love webtoon but this is very annoying and sometimes i have to open it 5 times for it to work again, even waiting for 20-30 minutes for it to \u201creset\u201d","2979":"I love WEBTOON & Lore Olympus. I purchased 50 coins not even 5 minutes ago so I could watch the episodes before they come out. Well the app prompted me to login to my account so wouldn\u2019t \u201close my coins\u201d so I did no issue, & proceeded to click on the episode in which it usually asks to use your coins but instead it takes me to coin shop & it reads 0 after I had already purchased them! I have basically been jipped $5","2980":"The app itself is good, but I find it irritating if I accidentally click the deal that sends me to Safari...if I click an ad...and if I try to go back to reading my story, it just keeps on doing it. Where it sends me to isn\u2019t secure on my phone.","2981":"So I love this app and I made a purchase for the 52 coins but it didn\u2019t pop up so I tried doing it again and turns out my card says I bought it twice but when I get on the app it only says I have 52 coins. Can I get a refund from the first purchase??","2982":"So my friend has the app and showed me little bit of the story and I just loved it so now I go on it every day. I just can\u2019t get enough of it, I swear, (I don\u2019t know how to end a review) so get it \n\n                Yeah","2983":"You should really consider on giving the app a dark mode look for those late night reads when u just can\u2019t sleep and wanna read some comic without burning the hell out of your eyes.","2984":"I had recently reset my device, I had logged in to my WEBTOON account and would not show what episode I left on. It only showed what I subscribed to. Can you please fix this, I really want to start reading WEBTOON but I can\u2019t because I do t know where I left off","2985":"I love this app so much I'll never uninstalled it this is super cool and it helps from anxiety from school thank you for making this app it's awesome helps me relax too! I love please never shut it down I will be really sad if you do and please replie this \u2764\ufe0f","2986":"Honestly I didn\u2019t like to read books but when I saw this app on instagram I downloaded it and loved there books thank you the maker of this app (now I love reading books)","2987":"I fricken love WEBTOON I read it every single day I\u2019m completely obsessed the only prob is that when I\u2019m in the car and or going somewhere I have to wait to get WiFi to read","2988":"So I\u2019ve had this app for a long time and just recently it started to freeze up when I would start to read something. This is why I gave it four stars otherwise it\u2019s an amazing app that has some great reads","2989":"The app is good overall but I have been reading lookism and it says it will come out but then it says you can read it soon and I have to wait an hour!","2990":"Ok look, I have never been interested in comics or ever cared until I saw an ad for WEBTOON. These are not like any other comics you will find these are written by authors, episodes uploaded weekly and the stories are straight up amazing I TOTALLY recommend!","2991":"One time I was reading a story and I was almost finished when it just took me to the start and it kept one doing it and doing it so I deleted be I\u2019m reinstalling because this is just a great app","2992":"I love this app and the creators on here. It\u2019s amazing but I would like a feature that will allow you to go to a creators profile so you can access their links and more or their creations.","2993":"In my opinion I love WEBTOON is my favorite reading app for me but the problem is the coins don\u2019t give me wrong I love Webtoons problem is I\u2019m going to have to buy coins all the time because of a webtoon that I read that is my only concern I would appreciate if you took off the coins","2994":"When I was going to buy this app it didn\u2019t have a money sign, so I didn\u2019t know it cost anything. I had 30 dollars in my account and I just looked at it and now I have like 25. Soooo I\u2019m like really confused because it did t say it cost anything and when I re downloaded it it said purchases have already been made and nothing was taken from my account. I\u2019m not asking for my money back I\u2019m just confused.","2995":"It looks dumb as a not full screen plus no rotation, and it looks even worse with the iOS 12 update. But iPad version was abandoned and doesn\u2019t even let you login. As someone with an iPad why would I choose a tiny phone screen over something bigger.","2996":"This is an incredible app that has got me looking forward to every Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday (everyone hates mondays) and is such a good thing for people who want to improve their reading I am deeply grateful for this app thanks and keep up da good work \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43","2997":"I love reading many great authors here and supporting them on their patreons and journey. But the new policy has made it difficult for many writers to continue the story they were pursuing. I would usually recommend this app but now I\u2019m not so sure because many great authors are no longer using it.","2998":"I used to really enjoy WEBTOON a lot before these new policies that are PREVENTING authors from sharing their work. Some of my favorite authors are being affected by both the Mature and Sexual User Postings policies and the Spam and Advertising polices which are very restrictive. I was enjoying WEBTOON and so were the authors but now it has become a painful experience.","2999":"I love WEBTOON very much, and it is absolutely fun to read the content from the many creators on the app, but now, thanks to a new policy (the Discover Policy), many  Webtoons are loosing the ability to become full stories, mainly because they revolve around the topics that are now not allowed to appear in Webtoons that are under the Discover tab."},"userName":{"0":"i dont have aname","1":"feebee2004","2":"torple reddenbacher","3":"Xia H","4":"Twilight Princess Fan lol","5":"BriannaS.","6":"Instagram user?","7":"Kimoralhh11","8":"SnowyFrost","9":"Cowubluh","10":"BIAStaehyung","11":"FANGIRL1624","12":"SamS56","13":"Kate Zhang's comments","14":"~WolfGirlMaeMazuki~","15":"jonboyle1","16":"Yourgurleatspotatochip1p1","17":"08Lonso","18":"@n0nym0u$ Wr!t3r","19":"a 3am ted talk","20":"HoneyBooBoo_112","21":"lmia15","22":"35Pika","23":"Iv.Penn","24":"Margeepargee \ud83e\udd73","25":"DailyDoseOfDnel","26":"vasthi_joseph","27":"A persons random comment.","28":"Lupe0604","29":"Anonymous222222211122","30":"summersotwinzzz","31":"UnderestematedChic","32":"Sgt.
